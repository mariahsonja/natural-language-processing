### NLP Jupyter Notebooks Examples in Python :snake: 

In this repository I added a collection of jupyter notebooks with 
examples of NLP models for *text summarization*, *text classification* and 
*text pre-processing* tasks using **TensorFlow Keras**, **NLTK**, 
**word2vec**, etc.

**It contains:**

- `data` data sets used in the models
- `transformers` sample usage of the transformers APIs
- `nltk` natural language toolkit examples 
- `tensorFlow-keras` keras examples
- `word2vec` example of model using word2vec



*This collection of Jupyter Notebooks came from my own studies and trainings I have done during the past years. They are all updated to be used with `Python 3.7`.*
