### If you are new to it, an overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables a computer to read, understand and process human language.

**How NLP works**

Current approaches to NLP are based on deep learning, a subgroup of AI that examines and uses patterns in data to improve a program's understanding. There are two main algorithms used to solve NLP problems:

- *Rule-based approach:* Grammatical rules created by experts in linguistics, or knowledge engineers.
- *Machine learning algorithms:* Machine learning models based on statistical methods to perform tasks after being fed examples (training data). 

**Benefits of NLP**

- Improves accuracy and efficiency when processing documentation.
- It has ability to: read, classify, summarize, extract information and sentiment from the texts.

**Usage of NLP**

- Chatbots for customer support
- Personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa

### NLP Jupyter Notebooks Examples in Python :snake: 

In this repository I added a collection of jupyter notebooks with 
examples of NLP models for *text summarization*, *text classification* and 
*text pre-processing* and tasks using **TensorFlow**, **NLTK**, 
**word2vec**, etc.

**It contains:**

- `data` data sets used in the models
- `nltk` natural language toolkit examples 
- `tensorFlow` tensorFlow NLP examples of *encoding-embeddings*,  *neural-network* models based, *text-processing*, etc.
- `transformers` sample usage of the transformers APIs
- `word2vec` example of model using word2vec


*This collection of Jupyter Notebooks came from my own studies and trainings I have done during the past years. They are all updated to be used with `Python 3.7`.*
