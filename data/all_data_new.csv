110CYL069.txt,"      November 15, 1996       Dear Personal Donor:       In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job, Robert has       learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about 40 minutes. His job       objectives call for him to do it in 30.       He has no time to waste.       Neither do we. With the help of friends like you, Goodwill has       continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing       society.       We don't waste time as we are helping the community. And we don't       waste money. The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to       continue our mission of helping people prepare for, find and keep       jobs.       In their December, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, U.S.       News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five ""Standout Good       Guys."" The magazine stated that Goodwill (as well as the other standouts)       is ""uniquely effective, innovative or valuable.""       While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the       true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on       problems that affect all of us.       Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment       barrier, the positive effects radiate throughout our community: The       business community welcomes not only another worker, but a consumer with       increased purchasing power. Parents act as role models of       self-sufficiency instead of dependency. Tax dollars that would have been       spent on public assistance are saved.       You and I know that solutions to difficult problems don't just happen.       At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our       services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day:       A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: ""You       can earn the money to support yourself and your family,"" she says. ""You       can get off welfare. I know you can... I did.""       A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview       to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing       training program. once his tears have subsided, he confirms what his       classmates have already figured out: he just received a job offer -- his       first in five years.       Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member       tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs. On his       way home, he shares the story with four people at a street corner. At the       next corner he tells five more.       In order to develop job skills, a man with some serious disabilities       begins working in Goodwill's industrial division. It takes a long time       for him to gain the self-confidence to work elsewhere in the community.       Eventually, he turns your support into a payoff for all of us. He proudly       leaves Goodwill to support himself.       These people and their successes are real. Just like the respect we've       earned from U.S. News & World Report. Just like the impact Goodwill's       work has on our community.       Real work. Real results. A real difference in people's lives -- in all       of our lives.       The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no       time to waste. Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of       their success. Your support helps provide real solutions.       Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously       to Goodwill today.

110CYL068.txt,"      Dear ,       A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success       stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill's help.       Here's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely       source: Goodwill's controller, Juli. She tells me that the 3,666 people       we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars. In       addition to that, by helping them find jobs, Goodwill reduced the state's       Public Support tab by an estimated $4 million. Your gift to Goodwill will       help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly       support our work.       What kind of work does Goodwill do?       Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities.       After Maureen's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant,       we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with       physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in       the middle of society. Remember what she said in my last letter? ""If I       wasn't working here...I would be sad...""       Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance. Sherry learned       through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the       welfare system and support her family. At Goodwill she gained in       self-confidence, in her vision of her future and in the job skills she       needed to find and keep a good job. ""Coming to Goodwill was the first       step toward my becoming totally independent. I am now... totally off of       welfare.""       Goodwill prepares people for life-long employment. Cornell found a       number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a       work-site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry. He trained in       desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with       new-found skills in a burgeoning industry. ""I've got more than a job;       I've got a career.""       Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill. After a lifetime of trials, Donna       not only earned her GED at Goodwill, she earned a job here. ""I rode a       bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow. I wanted to be there...I had my       second chance to change my life.""       Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their       own stories of success. Your support will help them go to work.       Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill       today!       Sincerely,       William A Carter, Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation       P.S. Your gift is a wise investment in the community.

Article247_327.txt,"            Even More ""Proving Rape""             Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial page's coverage of Juanita Broaddrick's rape charges against Bill Clinton (see ""Proving Rape ,"" ""More Proving Rape,"" as well as Michael Kinsley's ""Readme""column in the current issue) cries out for the introduction of the Scientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press responsibility. With that in mind, Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the Intellectual Dishonesty (henceforth to be known as the Indis ) Index . Here's how it works: Publications that refuse to acknowledge (even if to refute the importance of) highly significant but inconvenient facts in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one point for the initial offense. They will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact--and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow-up without making note of said inconvenient fact. Publications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of Fame . Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness of Joseph Stalin. (Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase ""intellectual dishonesty,"" because it's pompous and falsely suggests that only intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest. But Chatterbox doesn't know any other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of offense.)             For the purposes of this survey, the Wall Street Journal will be counted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal 's editorial page, because, in essence, it is.             The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma Kelsey, the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people partially corroborating Broaddrick's rape accusation, is the daughter of a man whose murderer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton. (A responsible account of the whole controversy in today's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration.) The Journal editorial page gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op-Ed by Dorothy Rabinowitz on Feb. 19. Because it has published three times since the initial omission, it scores an additional three points. And because it published an editorial Feb. 22 taunting the rest of the press for not following it on the story--and still didn't mention the pardon--it scores an extra two points. That comes to a total of six . Chatterbox feels certain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow-up tomorrow to tonight's NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview, which means that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it will be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest!             Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus points for having ""eventually convinced"" Broaddrick to grant an interview to the New York Times (as the Times reports in today's story). But the Scientific Method does not permit any tinkering with the Indis Index 's scoring procedures. And besides, Rabinowitz's efforts on the Times ' behalf weren't really unethical, just puzzling, given the two newspapers' intense rivalry. When Chatterbox asked the Journal 's DC bureau chief, Alan Murray, who exercised good judgment in not breaking the Broaddrick story (and--full disclosure-- is Chatterbox's former boss), to comment about a Journal employee's feeding sources to the Times , he replied: ""I don't really have any comment on what the edit page did. They do their thing, we do ours."" Which is what Journal news employees are instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing embarrassment.             For her part, Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf of the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them sound. ""Ms. Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared at the house in the a.m., and that she had refused an interview,"" Rabinowitz writes in an e-mail message. ""I asked her why she had decided to talk to the New York Post 's Steve Dunleavy, and refused a Times reporter. She said Dunleavy caught her by surprise. She asked if I thought it would be all right to talk to the Times reporter. I told her it would be--certainly as all right as talking to Dunleavy. She said, 'Well, I'm sorry I didn't.' She said she would if he called again. I passed this on to [ Times reporter] Felicity Barringer during our second day's interview chat.

VOL15_3.txt,"            Red Pants             While writers whose business it is to be witty often fail to produce, grave authors occasionally are mirthful when laughter is farthest from their minds.  From a lifetime of undisciplined reading with innocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind, I have gleaned a harvest of what I am pleased to denominate Red Pants items, a sampling of which follows. My designation derives from a splash of vivid writing in Francis Thompson's  A Corymbus for Autumn in which he proclaims how “day's dying dragon” was Panting red pants into the West.             In this trousers category, Thompson must share the limelight with Coleridge by virtue of the line in Kubla Khan : As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing.             Even Shelley may stake a claim, if only in the pajama division of this sector, thanks to his description in Epipsychidion of how ... the slow, silent night Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep.             Since everthing is to be found in Shakespeare, it is not surprising that on at least two occasions the Board has contributed his own Red Pants nuggets.  In Antony and Cleopatra (Act IV, Scene VIII, lines 14 et seq .)  Antony commands the wounded Scarus to ... leap thou, attire and all, Through proof of harness to my heart, and there Ride on the pants triumphing.             And in Othello (Act II, Scene I, line 80) Cassio utters the fervent prayer that Othello might             Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms.             A variation on this theme occurs in Alba de Céspedes' The Secret (translated from the Italian by Isabel Quigly: Simon and Schuster, New York, 1958, page 114) where she confides that “I still had a whole afternoon before me to spend, and I used it to tidy up my drawers....”  One may well wonder what Miss Stowe had in mind when, in Uncle Tom's Cabin (Chapter 5), she narrates how “Mrs. Shelby stood like one stricken. Finally, turning to her toilet, she rested her face in her hands, and gave a sort of groan.”  In this same vein, the mirthless Milton adds his bit to the general hilarity of nations when, in describing Mount Etna in Book I of Paradise Lost (lines 236-7) he penned And leave a singed bottom all involved With stench and smoke: ...             And in Chapter VI of Vanity Fair , when Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, sought to console Amelia for Joe Sedley's jilting of her dear Rebecca, Thackeray confides (indelicately?)  that Amelia wept confidentially on the housekeeper's shoulder “and relieved herself a good deal.”             Chuckles often emanate from the British employment of a term in a sense at variance with American usage.  There is that oft-quoted example, near the opening of Trial by Jury , where Defendant asks, “Is this the Court of the Exchequer?” and having been assured that it was, Defendant (aside) commands himself to “Be firm, be firm, my pecker.”  The British, of course, do not giggle at this bit of Gilbertian dialogue, since to them pecker means `courage,' as in the phrase “to keep your pecker up.”  Two of the more common examples of British-American divergence of usage are screw and knock up .  In Vanity Fair (Chapter 39), the niggardly Sir Pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat your American sophomore might fancy him to be when he “screwed his tenants by letter.”  He was simply making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees. Similarly, when in Chapter XXXIV of the same novel, Mrs. Bute reminds her husband that “You'd have been screwed in goal, Bute, if I had not kept your money,” she was not speaking of pleasures deferred.  In Bleak House (Chapter XXVII) Grandfather Smallweed, referring to Mr. George, warns Mr. Tulkinghorn that “I have him periodically in a vice.  I'll twist him, sir.  I'll screw him, sir.”  In Kipling's The Light That Failed (Chapter XIII), Torpenhow urges Dick to attend a party that night, “We shall be half screwed before the morning,” is his dismal sales pitch to Dick.             In Chapter VI of Vanity Fair , Thackeray reports on Joe Sedley's drunken avowal to wed Becky Sharp the next morning, even if he had to “knock up the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth,” in order to have him in readiness to perform the ceremony.  In Great Expectations (Chapter VI), we learn how “... Mr. Whopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad temper.”  And who could blame him?             Many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from the pure-minded use of a word that suggests unmentionable parts of the human body.  It does not take a too-wicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a lewd nature.  Who can, for instance, blame a youth with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing when he reads in Pater's Marius The Epicurean (Chapter V) a reference to Apuleius' The Golden Ass noting that “all through the book, there is an unmistakably real feeling for asses ...”?  In Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (Chapter VII), one reads about a boy “cudgelling an ass,” and one goes back over the passage to reassure himself that it does not contain a typographical error for “cuddling.”             One may be indulged a giggle even though he is sure that Isak Dinesen did not intend an impropriety when she recorded in Out of Africa (Part V, Chapter 4) how “Fathima's big white cock came strutting up before me.”  And one is certain that Kenneth Rexroth, in his American Poetry in the Twentieth Century (Herder and Herder, N.Y., 1971) did not intend to hint at closet biographical matter when, in Chapter I, he wrote that “Whitman's poems are full of men doing things together,” or, later in the same chapter, when he referred to “Whitman's joyous workmen swinging their tools in the open air.”  College freshman still read with flendish glee the first line in Canto I of Spenser's The Faerie Queene (and never mind the title!) that tells how             A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine.             In his poem Mr Nixon (from Hugh Selwyn Mauberley ), Ezra Pound's Mr. Nixon advises kindly             Don't kick against the pricks,             although the identities of the latter are not divulged.             One is entitled to speculate on what outrageous proposal the narrator had made in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, Vol. 2—Cities of the Plain (translated by C. K. Scott Moncrieff—Modern Library, N.Y., 1934, Page 90) to cause the Duchess to say, “Apart from your balls, can't I be of any use to you?” There is a famous letter penned by Rupert Brooke to his friend, Edward Marsh, from somewhere near Fiji (p. 463 of A Treasury of the World's Great Letters , Simon and Schuster, N.Y., 1940) in which he relates how he sends his native boy up a palm tree, where he “cuts off a couple of vast nuts ...” (macho victim not disclosed).  In the first chapter of Uncle Tom's Cabin , Miss Stowe offers a dialogue between Haley and Mr. Shelby, part of which goes, “ `Well,' said Haley, after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season, `what do you say?' ”  In Bleak House (Chapter XXIV) Dickens may cause some readers to blush when he wrote of Mr. George's blush that “He reddened a little through his brown.”             We must move ineluctably to a consideration of perfectly reputable words which, having acquired sexual connotations, cause adolescent—and often adult— hilarity, even when read by a person of only mildly prurient mind.  In Forster's A Passage to India (Chapter XXXI) a vivid picture is created by the sentence “Tangles like this still interrupted their intercourse.” Pages later (Chapter XXXVII), it is acknowledged that “He, too, felt that this was their last free intercourse.” Apparently from then on, it was going to have to be cash or credit card only.  In The Bride of Lammermoor (Chapter V), we are informed that the heroine “placed certain restrictions on their intercourse,” a limitation that might have been more usefully set in that same author's Rob Roy (Chapter VII) where we are told of the chance that the narrator and Miss Vernon might be “thrown into very close and frequent intercourse.”             A variation of this theme is found in Robert Browning's The Flight of the Duchess (Section V): —Not he!  For in Paris they told the elf Our rough North land was the Land of Lays,             even though it is generally acknowledged that Paris is número uno in this area of human activity.             More picturesque are the references to erections. An arresting one occurs in A Passage to India (Chapter XXI) in which Forster describes a small building as “a flimsy and frivolous erection,” while in The Mayor of Casterbridge (Chapter XVI) the Mayor himself “beheld the unattractive exterior of Farfrae's erection.”  A phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader.             Consider Dickens' sharp image in Bleak House (Chapter LIV) when he describes how “Sir Leicester leans back in his chair, and breathlessly ejaculates.... ” Or, in Nicholas Nickleby (Chapter XLVII), where that admirable novelist graphically portrays how old Arthur Gride “again raised his hands, again chuckled, and again ejaculated.”  And in his short tale, Lionizing , Edgar Allan Poe is quite candid in describing the reaction of one of his characters: “ ` Admirable! ' he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre.”             Alas for perfectly lovely words that acquire pejorative meanings over the years!  Earlier in this century, pansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete male, thereby cheapening forever lines like Shelley's noble image in Adonais (verse XXXIII): His head was bound with pansies over-blown,             not to mention Poe's odd allusion in For Annie : With rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies.             Or, more slap-stickish, E.F. Benson's action picture in Lucia in London (Chapter 8): “Georgie stepped on a beautiful pansy.”             Of more recent vintage is gay .  Nobody used to snicker at Chaucer's line (No. 5818) in The Prologe of the Wyf of Bathe , in which that harried dame asks: Why is my neghebores wif so gay?             In his poem The Menagerie , one of William Vaughan Moody's characters advises: If nature made you so graceful, don't get gay,             while in Othello (ah, the Bard again!)  in his dialogue with Desdemona and Emilia on the praise of women, Iago refers to the kind that Never lack'd gold, and yet went never gay. (Act II, Scene I, line 150)             And what in the world is one to make of William Butler Yeats's startling revelation in his poem Lapis Lazuli (from Last Poems ) that They know that Hamlet and Lear are gay.?             Indeed it is an amusing, albeit utterly wasteful pastime to pursue the quest for Red Pants examples. May good cess befall all such quixotically misguided readers!  One caveat: never assume blithely that an odd word or suspicious phrase is as lubricious as it sounds. In The Bride of Lammermoor (Chapter VI) Bucklaw vows, “I will chop them off with my whinger,” and one feels quite let down when he learns that a whinger is but a whinyard, which is merely a short sword. “Turning a corner of the Mazza Gallerie into a women's tennis store, I was startled to see ... hordes of giggling high school girls ... ” [From an article by Dorothy Gilliam in the Washington Post , .  Submitted by .]             LIGHT REFRACTIONS             If you are a fan of old-fashioned jazz—what is now known as “traditional” or “trad” jazz—you are familiar with one of the standard “jump tunes” of the genre—a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble . Even if you are not a fan, you must have heard it as least a dozen times.  It is the one that goes, “Dah! Dah!  Dah!  Dah!  da-dat-dat-dah!  Da-de-da-de-da-de-dat-dat-dah !  da-de-da-de-da-de-dat-dat-dah!” That's it; sure; you've heard it.             I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble back in about 1940, when I was in my early teens. My memory is rickety, but I am sure my first recording was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE, and I think, though I am less sure, that it was played by the late “Muggsy” Spanier, who was, to my mind, one of the greatest of jazz trumpeters.  Later, I got another recording of the same tune, this one by, I think, Mezz Mezzrow.  The label said, MUSKAT RAMBLE.  I thought that was surely the first time I had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in, of all things, a simple title on a simple 78-rpm record.  (This, remember, was in my youth, and it was a time when typographical errors were called typographical errors, not typos—at least by kids in junior high.)  Some time later, I got still another version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE, with still another version of the title.  This time, it was MUSCAT RAMBLE. That, I thought, was really absurd.  Not only had they left out the “R”; they'd changed the “K” to “C”.  Now, it made no sense at all.  On the other hand, I reasoned, if there were, in fact, some sort of cat called a muscat, perhaps it wasn't so outrageous.  I looked up muscat in my Webster's and found that it is a `variety of grape.' To name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous.  I was young and, by today's standards, at least, pathetically innocent.             During my time in senior high, and, after that, in the Army Air Force, I had other things on my mind (there was a war on, after all), and I didn't give the MUSKRAT-MUSKAT-MUSCAT RAMBLE problem any thought.             Speaking of my time in the AAF, which was utterly undistinguished, I think I must make a confession. Now might be as good a time as any to reveal a theft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour, Indiana.  It was winter and bitterly cold.  The wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with what seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our bodies.  One day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero, I took shelter in the service club. There was the omnipresent phonograph, or Vic , short for Victrola, and the stack of records next to it.  In those days, people as a rule did not take much care of phonograph records.  Usually the records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks, where they picked up dust, scratched one another, and traded static electricity.  I was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records, and I came across three Bessie Smiths.  I played all three, and the few other G.I.s in the room, which was quite large—big enough for a fair-sized dance with a small orchestra—either paid no attention or asked me to put on something by Glenn Miller or Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead.  Among Bessie's numbers were Dying Gambler's Blues, Sing Sing Prison Blues , and one I had never heard called Black Mountain Blues , which has the imcomparable lines, Home in Black Mountain a chile' will smack yo' face; Home in Black Mountain a chile' will smack yo' face; Babies cry for liquor an' all the birds sing bass.             and Goin' back to Black Mountain, me an' my razor an' my gun; Goin' back to Black Mountain, me an' my razor an my gun; Goin' cut him if he stan' still, goin' shoot him if he run.             I was, and still am, captivated by “Babies cry for liquor an' the birds sing bass,” and in the arrogance of my youth, I was certain that nobody else on the airfield either knew or cared who Bessie Smith was, nor would any other G.I. be enchanted by basso birds, so I turned thief.  I can't remember how I did it, but somehow I smuggled those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough.  I kept them in good shape until my last 78-rpm turntable died.             End of digression and back to MUSKRAT-KAT-CAT: Muskrat Ramble is credited to Edward “Kid” Ory and Ray Gilbert.  “Kid” Ory played great jazz trombone. The only thing I know about Gilbert is that I find him listed as co-author of Muskrat Ramble .             About thirty years ago, when I was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand, I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that I thought might be exactly right for my sauce.  It wasn't bad, The wine jogged my thoughts back to Muscat Ramble .  Muscatel is made from muscat grapes, is sometimes called muscat , and, being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content, is the booze of choice for a great many wines.  An old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthday—meaning twenty years of AA sobriety—a couple of years ago, tells me that when he was on the skids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk tank, the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle and Napa Valley smoke .             I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune.  My reasoning is that it is not likely that “Kid” Ory or Ray Gilbert had ever seen a muskrat, and it's even less likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling.  Muskrats, according to my encyclopedia, look like giant rats, are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds, have partially webbed feet, and do a good deal of swimming. They do not appear to do much rambling.  Muscat, or muscatel, on the other hand, is found on skid rows all over the land.  A guy with a bottle-shaped brown paper bag, damp and wrinkled at its upper end, has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet wine of high proof, and the odds are pretty good you would find it is a muscadoodle .  After the guy finishes his Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off, he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix.  Now he is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his roadmapped eyes.  I suspect that that is precisely the song's origin.             My theory is that the “r” got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat . It is the same reason most of us, I assume, have heard, “He's in the hospital with prostrate trouble.”  Prostrate is a more common word that prostate , so prostrate is what we get.  The “r” fits in naturally.  I got a strange sort of corroboration from my good friend Rosy McHargue, who is now pushing eighty-seven years and has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbands—Benny Goodman, Red Nichols, Ted Weems, and a slew of others.  Rosy, too, had seen the tune as Muskrat, Muskat , and Muscat .  I asked him what he thought the original title was.  He had known “Kid” Ory well, and he said, “You know, Tom, I'm not exactly sure.  I once asked Ory about it and he said, `It's m-u-s-c-a-t.  Muskrat .'  So I think that's just the way everyone said muscat .”             There you are.  I find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually.  I picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water, but I wouldn't call that rambling.  On the other hand, a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat level—now that has a touch of poetry. Maybe not in the same class with “all the birds sing bass,” but poetry, nevertheless.             As a nonexpert, although interested, subscriber to VERBATIM, it is “a bit mysterious” to me that the singular noun absence takes the plural verb are .  I refer to the first sentence of your article about the Longman Dictionary [XV,1].             Helen W. Power, in “Women on Language; Women in Language,” [XV,2] may bewail the insensitivity of the male.  But she betrays her own elitist insensitivity when she describes a flight attendant as “the person who passes peanuts on an airplane.”  I hope Ms./Miss/Mrs. Power never needs to draw on the considerable first-aid and emergency training that every attendant must master.             Antipodean Newsletter             Leonard Bloomfield, having begun with a theory of meaning which emphasized the environment in which objects were present and named, had to add the obvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is not present.  I have lately been reading accounts of the exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of Australia in the 1870s and I have become very aware of the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency of particular items in discourse.  In the desert the missing necessity is water.  As the explorer Ernest Giles put it, the explorer's experience is a “baptism worse than that of fire—the baptism of no water.”             My impression was that in the journals of desert explorers the word water , alone or in compounds, and words relating to water, were unusually frequent.  It is, I suppose, likely that people with little money must think of money more than the well-off do and that the hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty on drink.  Here was a chance to quantify such things.  I decided to make a count of words relating to water in reports of desert exploration.             Taking quite at random a single page (page 7) in the journals of the Gregory brothers recording an early (1846) exploration of country east and north of Perth, I find the word water used fifteen times.  Ten pages on (page 17), water occurs nine times but there are also the related words stream (twice), well (twice), pool, channel , and the circumlocution “essential element.” Two words, dew and shower , refer in the context to the presence of water; the rest are in contexts indicating its absence.             I tried another explorer, Ernest Giles.  Taking page 17 again, I was reminded that Giles is rather given to semi-serious poetic diction at times, and we find him referring to the presence of water in the Finke River as “the stream purling over its stony floor” or, quoting some bygone poet, “brightly the brook through the green leaflets, giddy with joyousness, dances along.”  Perhaps present water called for some stylistic celebration.  Two hundred pages further on there is less exuberance in the circumlocution “that fluid so terribly scarce in the region,” and in three other references water is simply water .  Giles is not always waxing poetic and may, like other explorers, be useful as a source for the history of Australian and general English.  His use of the word tank to refer to a hollowed-out reservoir (“Gibson dug a small tank and the water soon cleared”) antedates the OED , for instance.             Since this linguistic-statistical study of an obsession might well prove to be an important contribution to psycholinguistics, I decided to make a larger sample of watery words, choosing the straightforward journals of Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton, who led an expedition across the western interior of Australia in 1873-4.  In a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages (151-60 of the published journal) there were twenty-eight occurrences of the word water (eight of them in compounds), no page being without at least one example. In addition, there was a rich collection of words relating to water, not necessarily indicating its presence. “Hoping to find a lake” is included, though of course it doesn't indicate the presence of water.  Even words which are usually of more general reference are brought into relation with water in a text like this. Gum-trees or rocks (in areas of sand) appear as signs of possible water.  Apart from these words and lake , words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include pool, springs, drainage hole, clay hole, flood, channel, water-courses, water-hole, rock-hole, drink, drinkable, running water, stream , and native well .             The last two items merit comment.  Stream is often said not to be used in Australia except in metaphorical ways, normally being replaced by creek . Warburton's use: “sandbanks intercept the stream, which finally splits into narow water-courses and spreads itself over the plains, and so it ends as a creek” suggests a somewhat more complex relation between the two words.  British-born explorers did not set out to write Australian English, of course.  Gregory uses stream in the way normal in England; Giles consistently refers to gens in the hills of central Australia, though glen is not current (outside place-names) in contemporary Australian English.             The other name, native well is, as a later explorer David Carnegie, author of Spinifex and Sand (1898), points out, a misnomer.  He believes native wells are essentially rock-holes (depressions in rock) buried in fairly shallow sand, which, when hollowed out by the natives, appear to be wells.  This sort of misnomer leads Carnegie to suppose that “to the uninitiated no map is so misleading as that of West Australia where lakes are salt-bogs without surface water, springs seldom run, and native `wells' are merely tiny holes in the rock, yielding from 0 to 200 gallons.”             Carnegie also describes namma-holes and soaks as sources of water.  Soaks are shallow wells sunk near the base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir. Namma-holes have been variously described; to Carnegie they are depressions on the surface of rocks, often with a rounded bottom, where stones are often found, suggesting that the stones have something to do with the formation of the holes.             Some nostalgic early Australians deplored the loss in our speech of English country words, the glens and streams (alive, anyway, in the journals of explorers), coppices and brooks, woods, becks , and rivulets .  Perhaps these words did not really fit.  We might have done better with Arabic-speaking settlers.  Wadi , for instance, would describe an inland creek rather well. Be that as it may, a later Australian visitor to English drizzle might feel nostalgic when thinking of the parched and thirsty but water-obsessed vocabulary developed in the drier areas of our sunburnt land.             Favorite Grammatical Game: Puzzling Pronouns             Here is a game just made to while away the hours on a commuter train with your favorite author, a perfect place to hunt for Puzzling Pronouns .                Fowler lists five instances where a careless writer can go wrong.  There is really no excuse, Fowler says (not he says!), but here we give examples of his third case only, where “there should not be two parties justifying even a momentary doubt about which the pronoun represents.”  And here the deluge of printed matter abounds with such specimens that one would suppose them to be the rule rather than the exceptions. It is a game that is like fishing in a barrel, but more stimulating mentally.  I am not picking on the following authors; it is just a random catch.             In Thomas Hardy's The Hand of Ethelberta , it is suggested by Ethelberta that she and some others go to see Milton's tomb in Cripplegate church.  Her suitor, Neigh, who had proposed marriage in a previous chapter, appears somewhat apprehensive at Ethelberta's suggestion.  This apprehension is observed by a Mr. Belmaine and mistaken by him for an indication that Neigh has been dragged into going to the church against his will “by his over-hasty wife.”  One wonders whether the marriage had secretly taken place between the consecutive chapters!  You see, it is Belmaine's wife who was doing the dragging.             Somerset Maugham was a good and careful grammarian but now and then he slipped.  In The Letter , a solicitor, Mr. Joyce, is approached by a Mr. Crosbie: He spoke beautiful English, accenting each word with precision, and Mr. Joyce had often wondered at the extent of his vocabulary....             Sometimes I wonder about the extent of my own vocabulary, too, but really, not when I'm interviewing a client.             From The Once and Future King , by T. H. White: Naturally it was Lancelot who rescued her.  Sir Boss had managed to find him at the abbey, during his two days' absence, and now he came back in the nick of time to fight Sir Mador for the queen.  Nobody who knew him would have expected him to do anything else, whether he had been sent away in disgrace or not—but, as it was thought he had left the country, his return did have a dramatic quality.             Not to say a quality of confusion—pronoun-cedly so.             From Oh What a Paradise it Seems , by John Cheever: The size of Chisholm's teeth, the thickness of his glasses, his stoop and the spring with which he walked all marked him, Sears thought, as a single-minded reformer.  His marriage, Sears guessed, would have been unsuccessful and his children would have difficulty finding themselves.             No wonder — we've lost them already.             Mark Twain poses us a little mystery in Pudd'nhead Wilson: which knife does the killing?  Quiet now. Lights, action: I was asleep, but Luigi was awake, and he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed.  He slipped the knife out of the sheath and was ready, and unembarrassed by hampering bedclothes, for the weather was hot and we hadn't any.  Suddenly that native rose at the bedside, and bent over me with his right hand lifted and a dirk in it aimed at my throat; but Luigi grabbed his wrist, pulled him downward, and drove his own knife into the man's neck.  That is the whole story.             Well, was it Luigi's knife or the native's?  If we had only that scene to go by we would never really know, and all because of a Puzzling Pronoun —or two! Oh, it can lead one to a rhymed couplet: He loves his brother and his wife, Does he live a double life?             Give me my grammatical games any day to a crossword puzzle.             The Joys and Oys of Yiddish             Rabbi Robert Schenkerman             Temple Beth Jacob             When Isaac Bashevis Singer was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978, he remarked in his acceptance speech: The high honor bestowed upon me is also a recognition of the Yiddish language—a language of exile, without a land, without frontiers, not supported by any government, a language which possesses no words for weapons, ammunition, military exercises, war tactics. There is a quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude for every day of life, every crumb of success, each encounter of love.  In a figurative way, Yiddish is the wise and humble language of us all, the idiom of a frightened and hopeful humanity.             The word Yiddish derives from the German judisch `Jewish.'  The principal parent of Yiddish is High German, the form of German encountered by Jewish settlers from northern France in the eleventh century.  Yiddish is written in the characters of the Hebrew alphabet and from right to left and enjoys borrowing words from Russian, Polish, English, and all the other languages and countries along the routes that Jews have traveled during the past thousand years. Journalist Charles Rappaport once quipped, “I speak ten languages—all of them Yiddish.”             Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out for hundreds of years, the language is spoken today by millions of people throughout the world—Russia, Poland, Rumania, France, England, Israel, Africa, Latin America, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the United States, where, like the bagel, it was leavened on both coasts, in New York and Hollywood.  It is spoken even in Transylvania: A beautiful girl awakens in bed to find a vampire at her side.  Quickly she holds up a cross. “Zie gernisht helfen,” smiles the vampire. Translation: “It won't do you any good.”             Most of us already speak a fair amount of Yiddish (Yinglish) without fully realizing it.  Webster's Third New International Dictionary lists about 500 Yiddish words that have become part of our everyday conversations, including: cockamamy (or cockamamie) `mixed-up, ridiculous.' fin slang for `five-dollar bill,' from finf, the Yiddish word for `five.' gun moll a double clipping of gonif's Molly, Yiddish for `thief's girl.' kibitzer `one who comments, often in the form of unwanted advice, during a game, often cards.' mavin `expert.' mazuma `money.' mish-mosh `mess.' schlep to `drag or haul.' schlock `shoddy, cheaply produced merchandise.' schmeer the `entire deal,' the `whole package.' schnoz slang for `nose.' yenta `blabbermouth, gossip; woman of low origins.'             ... and so on through the whole megillah : `long, involved story.'             A number of poignant Yiddish words defy genuine translation into English: chutzpa `nerve; unmitigated gall;' a quality we admire within ourselves, but never in others.  In his delightful study, The Joys of Yiddish (McGraw-Hill 1968), Leo Rosten offers two classic definitions.  “Chutzpa is that quality enshrined in a man, who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.  A chutzpanik may be defined as the man who shouts `Help!  Help!'  while beating you up.” mensch a `real authentic human being—a person.' naches the `glow of pleasure-plus-pride that only a child can give to its parents': “This is my son, the Doctor!” oy not so much a word as an entire vocabulary, as Rosten observes: “can express any emotion, from trivial delight to the blackest woe.” oy vay; oy vay in mir literally, “Oh, pain,” but, in its long or short form, can be used for anything from condolence to lament: On August 6, 1945, the world's first nuclear weapon was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.  Two hundred and eighty-two thousand human beings died and tens of thousands more were left burned, maimed, and homeless.  [Albert] Einstein, whose letter to Roosevelt had initiated the American effort that resulted in the atom bomb and whose special theory of relativity formed its theoretical basis, heard the news on the radio. For a long time he could only find two Yiddish words traditionally used by Jews in such circumstances: “Oi vey.” —The Little, Brown Book of Anecdotes tsuris the gamut of painful emotions—some real, some imagined, some self-inflicted.             Yiddish is especially versatile in describing those poor souls who inhabit the world of the ineffectual, and each is assigned a distinct place in the gallery of pathetic types: schmo, schmendrik, schnook, schmegegge, schlep, schlub, schmuck, putz, klutz, kvetch , and nudnik .  Yiddish easily coins new names for new personalities: a nudnik is a `pest'; a phudnik is a `nudnik with a Ph.D.'  The rich nuances that suffuse this roll call are seen in the timeless distinction between a schlemiel `clumsy jerk' and a schlimazel `habitual loser': the schlemiel inevitably trips and spills his hot soup—all over the schlimazel.  (And the nebbish is the one who has to clean it up.)             The Yiddish language, through its color, its target-accurate expressions, its raw idioms, and its sayings exudes a refreshing magic and laughter, mixed with sober thought, that has been handed down from generation to generation and from nation to nation.  Yiddish never apologizes for what it is—the earthy, wise soul of an expressive people learning that life is but a mingled yarn, good and ill together.             Which reminds us of the zaftig `buxom, well-rounded' blonde who wore an enormous diamond to a charity ball.  “It happens to be the third most famous diamond in the whole world,” she boasted.  “The first is the Hope diamond, then comes the Kohinoor, and then comes this one, which is called the Lipschitz.”             “What a stone!  How lucky you are!”             “Wait, wait,” said the lady.  “Nothing in life is all mazel [`good luck'].  Unfortunately, with this famous Lipschitz diamond comes also the famous Lipschitz curse.”             The other women gasped and asked, “And what is the famous Lipschitz curse?”             “Lipschitz,” sighed the lady.             The Women's History of the Word             Those who are not familiar with feminist writings may find it useful and interesting to consider a book, recently published in Britain, that is typical of the harsher brand of such works.  The work in question offers nothing regarding language, so its review here is ancillary to the main function of VERBATIM.  The feminist movement is very much alive in Britain, and the “Greenham Common Women” are probably largely responsible for much of the national sentiment against the Cruise missiles installed at an American base near that village.  In Britain, as elsewhere, most books by feminist writers are reviewed by women, usually feminists. Men are seldom assigned to review them, possibly because the editor fears that they will be either ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised, if not biased against them, or because the editor is a woman. Because writing an unfavorable review of a (bad) feminist book would be tantamount to treachery, such books are often unjustifiably praised, as was the case with this work by Rosalind Miles, which was well received on its publication in June.             According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this distinctly unpleasant book, Rosalind Miles is head of the Centre for Women's Studies at Coventry Polytechnic, a lecturer, broadcaster, journalist, and author of several other books, including a “highly acclaimed” biography of Ben Jonson.  One might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship, but the text does not bear out the promise.             For the most part, the book consists of a rewriting of history, from the dawn of time, with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes: the “fact” that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization (as the development of agriculture, for instance), often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men; and the “fact” that women have long been subjected to domination by men.  Miles suggests that such domination is a recent phenomenon—only a couple of thousand years old—for she points to the clear superiority of women in (primitive) religions and matriarchies, right on through to the Egyptian dynastic rulers.  At one point, she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of counting (in order to keep track of menstruation) and, probably by the same token, astronomy.  She quotes (and, presumably, accepts) another source which holds that “woman first awakened in humankind the capacity to recognize abstracts.”  If you believe that balderdash, you'll believe anything.             In the good old days, we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves. Recent speculation has it that they were not slaves but—what would one call them? — ordinary laborers. Here comes Miles, authoritatively quoting Diodorus, the Greek historian, who recorded (60-30BC) that “innocent women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves whose forced labour built the pyramids: ... bound in fetters, they work continually without being allowed any rest by night or day. They have not a rag to cover their nakedness, and neither the weakness of age nor women's infirmities are any plea to excuse them, but they are driven by blows until they drop dead.”  [p.49]             As the pyramids were already about 2500 years old when Diodorus wrote his World History , one is given to wonder what his authority might have been for such a vivid description.  It is even less comprehensible how a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery to promulgate it.  Miles's book is riddled with many similar distortions, convenient omissions, and generalizations: ... Women have always commanded over half the sum total of human intelligence and creativity. From the poet Sappho, who in the sixth century BC was the first to use the lyric to write subjectively and explore the range of female experience, to the Chinese polymath Pan Chao (Ban Zhao), who flourished around AD 100 as historian, poet, astronomer, mathematician and educationalist, the range is startling.  In every field, women too numerous to list were involved in developing knowledge and contributing to the welfare of their societies as they did so: the Roman Fabiola established a hospital where she worked both as nurse and doctor, becoming the first known woman surgeon before she died in AD 399.  [p.52]             Earlier, on page 49, we learnt about Agnodice, “who lived to become the world's first known woman gynaecologist,” in the fourth century BC.  Clearly, this rosily checkered past was soon to be replaced, chiefly, it seems, as Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Confucian-Buddhist cultures flourished.  It was not too bad early on, when, according to Miles, the seven Maccabean martyrs who “saved Judaism” did so only at the instigation of their mother.  Miles continues: In early Christianity likewise, women found not merely a role, but an instrument of resistance to male domination; in choosing to be a bride of Christ they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male fry.  Thousands of young women helped to build the church of God with their body, blood and bones when frenzied fathers, husbands or fiancés preferred to see them die by fire, sword or the fangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout [sic] the duty and destiny of womanhood.  [p.63]             But the situation soon deteriorated: Even St. Paul, later the unregenerate prophet of female inferiority, was forced to acknowledge the help he received from Lydia, the seller of purple dyes in Philippi.  [ibid.]             This rewriting of history is punctuated by an array of four-letter invectives applied to males and by adjectives like brilliant, unusual, inspiring , and so forth to women.  Citing a Judaic law-book of the 16th century which identified a woman for the days preceding, during, and following her period as niddah `impure,' Miles has the lack of taste to write the following:. As a final stroke, in a grim foreshadowing of what the future held in store for the Jews, the niddah had to wear special clothing as a badge of her separate and despised status.  [p.83]             Here and there in this morass of misunderstanding, Miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with the eminent anthropologist Joseph Campbell.  Campbell, known for his extensive analyses of the world's mythologies, religions, and cultures, noted the marked bias against women emerging from Judaic concepts, later reinforced by Christian and Islamic doctrine. Most of the religions of the world connected woman with mother earth, fertility, and all the other progenetic and nurturing associations, and this was borne out in the cultures of the people.  According to Campbell, the only godlike female figure in the Bible is the Virgin Mary, and she appears, identified as virgin, only in the Gospel according to Luke.  As Luke was a Greek, Campbell suggested that Mary was a carryover from the paganism of the ancient Greek pantheon. Although this might help explain the Judeo-Christian-Muslim tendencies to subjugate women, treating them essentially as chattel, it does not account for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures, notably that of Japan.  It is not entirely clear whether Campbell was commenting on Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. as they once existed, conceptually, for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering to those religous precepts.             Campbell held that the ancient mythologies and religions are allegorical and that there was no real distinction between gods and goddesses, who were given sexual identity when in human form only to make them more meaningful.  With all respect, that seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex for this discussion, though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities (or divinity) when we come to examine Judaism and its congeners and progeny.  Other debatable aspects are the questions of whether the debasement of women is a reflection of the theology or the ritual, whether the scripture of any religion should be understood allegorically or literally, and so forth.  If there is something wrong, it behooves us to get at the roots of the problem, not to flail about wildly, for only after the source of a disease has been identified can one properly investigate its cure.             “History according to Rosalind Miles” blasts away at the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating them will effect a cure of the disease.  In this jeremiad, males are viewed as the “enemy,” and are so characterized throughout the book, which concludes with exhortations to engage the foe and a strident call to arms (though not men's).             Laurence Urdang             Archaeology & Language             [A VERBATIM Book Club Selection.]             Just when you thought it was safe to assume that we now know all we are ever likely to know about the past, someone digs another hole and unearths (literally or figuratively) some ancient artifact: one day it is a fragile scroll, found in a cave near the Dead Sea, that turns out to be pre-Biblical; the next day it is an entire terracotta army of Chinese soldiers: the next it is a skull, excavated from the Olduvai Gorge, that compels anthropologists (once again) to revise their guesses about the earliest stages of Homo sapiens sapiens vs hominids.  Most of the relies from the past are gone forever, destroyed by the plows of countless generations of farmers, reduced to rubble by erosion, by conquerors, by prehistoric (and modern) urban developers, by fire and flood, and just by time.  Many, we may hope, have not yet been found.  The interest in man's forebears did not become fashionable upon the publication, a few years ago, of Roots : on a far larger scale, we have been trying to discover all we can about the origins not of men but of man.  Strange to say, however, that interest does not seem to be more than a few hundred years old: if the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Indians, the Chinese and other peoples were curious about their own prehistory, I have not heard of it. Perhaps the fascination with man's past grew out of the obsession with ruins evinced by Romanticism; certainly, modern archaeology seems to have followed close behind, for the excavation of the supposed site of Troy took place only about 100 years ago.  Perhaps it is just as well, for only by the means available to modern science are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts that we find and, through radiocarbon dating, determine their approximate age.             Archaeology is a popular pursuit, and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums.  Not so paleolinguistics, or the reconstruction of ancient languages.  Even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse: Classical Latin and Greek, Hebrew, and a few other languages are better documented than others; but for most all we have to go on are a handful of tablets here, a few inscriptions there, barely enough in many cases to allow us to identify the language, let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning.  Perhaps one day we shall find an Etruscan library, buried deep in the Italian countryside; but for the present, we have to make do with what we have, which is precious little. About languages that had no writing system, we know nothing at all.  But some very clever comparative linguists, beginning in Germany in the 19th century, theorized about how the nature of the ancestors of the more modern tongues.  In some instances, ancient languages have been decoded, some from multilingual inscriptions.  The work of Jean Francois Champollion (1790-1832) in deciphering hieroglyphics from the Rosetta Stone was an astonishing accomplishment, for it enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient Egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we have today about their civilization, which lasted for about 2600 years.  Another significant break-through was that of Michael Ventris (1922-1956), who deciphered the Linear B script found on Crete and identified it as an early form of Greek.  From the standpoint of language, Ventris's work was more important, particularly because it filled in a gap in our knowledge of the early states of Indo-European languages.             Many years ago, a linguistic scholar counted all of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence. The total was approximately 2800, but that is probably only a vague estimate: he undoubtedly missed some; some have sprung up since his time (modern Hebrew, for instance); and some have vanished.  The exact count is unimportant and, at best, spurious, for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what distinguishes dialect from language.  Then, too, one must examine the techniques used to group the many languages of the world.             Linguists examining Classical Greek, Latin, German, English, Slavic, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Lithuanian, Iranian, Hindi, and the other languages of India and Europe found that there were correspondences among many of the common words. Some, like French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, had more in common with one another than they did with, say, German, English, Swedish, Danish, and Dutch, which, in turn, bore only a remote resemblance to Russian and Polish, on the one hand, and the two extant varieties of, say, Gaelic, on the other.  One rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes, for after years of laboriously categorizing these languages, the number of different main branches (called families and subfamilies) came to about ten.  Ingeniously, certain differences between families were explained by various phonetic shifts that (inexplicably) took place in one language group but not in another.  Although certain other languages were geographically nearby, it was impossible to establish any resemblances between them, hence Basque, for example, is not classified as being in the same family with other European languages, nor are Hungarian and Finnish, both of which belong to their own group. At the conclusion of this vast exercise, done without the aid of computers, there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that linked together languages spoken, in earlier times, from Britain as far east as Chinese Turkestan and from India as far north as Lappland.  Charts showing the chief languages and their derivations can be found in many dictionaries—inside the front cover of The Random House Unabridged , for example.  Because linguists are constantly learning more and more about the relationships among languages, it is best to avoid using an older chart; for the same reason, it would be wise not to stake too much on the accuracy of even a current chart.             The languages discussed here are what are usually called the Indo-European family; similar family trees could be drawn for the Semitic languages, Sino-Tibetan, Japanese, Bantu, Malayo-Polynesian, and so on. Each is a distinct phylum; although there may be word-borrowing among them, lexicon is considered less important in the classification of languages than structure and grammar.  It is important, too, to note that writing systems are irrelevant: for instance, Polish is written (today) using the Roman alphabet, but Russian, a related Slavic language, uses the Cyrillic; Yiddish, a Germanic language, is written in Hebrew characters; Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit, which resemble one another rather closely in some respects, all use different alphabets; and early examples, utterly unrecognizable to untrained readers of modern languages, were written in cuneiform, quite suitable for writing on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus, and hieroglyphics. It would be nice to think that while linguists were working so hard to organize languages, they were working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials.  But only rarely did they collaborate and, with few exceptions, their work was not correlated in a systematic way.  Schliemann, who discovered the site of Troy, used the evidence in Homer's Iliad to determine his digging site, where any ruins had long since disappeared from view.  In many other places, the ancient sites lay buried—and still do—beneath modern cities: modern property owners quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of an ancient town will be found several yards below. today, before a new building is erected in London, an archaeological team examines the cleared site for its archaeological significance.  But there, as everywhere else, nothing can interfere with progress and, regardless of the finds and their importance, the archaeologist must eventually yield to the bulldozer.  Notwithstanding, even the brief glimpses afforded by such investigations can provide some insight into civilizations that existed hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of years earlier.             Based on the sparse evidence available, linguists theorized about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested.  In other words, based on what they knew about a group of languages which were documented, they tried to imagine the language that they sprang from.  In most cases, they dealt with words and functional elements, creating what are called reconstructions in hypothetical family prototypes called, variously, Proto-Latin, Proto-Greek, Proto-Germanic, Proto-Indo-Iranian, and so forth, the ultimate goal being to posit a single language called Proto-Indo-European. That is not entirely true, for linguists know too much about language to suggest that there ever was, literally, a single language from which all Indo-European languages descended.  Nonetheless, it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of proto-dialects which can be referred to as Proto-Indo-European. It seems only natural that once an original language, or Ursprache , was posited, the next step was to speculate on its source, or Urheimat .  That is what Renfrew has tried to do.  Essentially, he proposes that the parent of all Indo-European languages was itself born in central Anatolia, whence it spread eastward, westward, and northward, being modified by the influences of the languages with which it came into contact, till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable, modern manifestations which we categorize into Germanic, Hellenic, Italic, Indo-Iranian, Anatolian, Armenian, Celtic, Tocharian, Albanian, and BaltoSlavic.             I have no quarrel with Renfrew's theory—notwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of the Black Sea region and the Volga steppes.  It is difficult for the nonspecialist reader (like me) to assess the validity of his arguments, which are based on his contention that the language (and its congeners) were carried along by the spread of nomad pastoralism.  Using the evidence available, Renfrew contends that the original Indo-European language, closely related to Hittite, separated after 6500 BC, with the IE languages of western Europe developing from western Anatolia and those of Iran, India, and Pakistan from the eastern division. The choice between the prevailing theory and Renfrew's depends on whether one accepts a “wave” theory, first promulgated more than a hundred years ago by Johnanes Schmidt, a German linguist, or one of indigenous development.  Pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture from Turkmenia or a late development of the Indus civilization.  Renfrew accepts the wave theory, and in the last two thirds of Archaeology & Language he sets forth his arguments in its favor.  Unfortunately, the presentation of his linguistic argument, where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology, where he is on more familiar territory, is disorganized and repetitious.  It is difficult to place all the blame on Renfrew, for his editor should have noticed the lack of coherence.  The result is an argument that is persuasive but scarely convincing.             Nevertheless, good books on archaeology assimilable by laymen are not easy to find, and if the reader can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned about the precise birthplace of Indo-European, Archaelogy & Language provides an interesting march through the millennia of prehistory in seven-league boots.             Laurence Urdang             Webster's Electronic Thesaurus             This software consists of two disks, one labeled Installation and Program, the other Synonym Linguibase, and a manual.  The manual sets forth everything with clarity, and the program is simple to install, requiring only a few minutes.  Only one thing made me a little suspicious when cranking up the system: in the descriptive text that appears on the screen, the word labeled is spelt “labelled”—decidedly un-American. However, I went ahead, and, since I was typing the text you are reading, returned to the beginning of the paragraph to see how some of these words would fare. I looked up the word preceding and was, after a brief moment, asked to type in the word, which I did.  The screen bloomed forth with the following:             Query: preceding             1)  adj being before especially in time or arrangement             There were also some other parts of speech: one definition for the preposition and three for the verb (participial) senses.  I called up the synonyms for the adj and the following appeared:             Synonyms: antecedent, anterior, foregoing, former, past, precedent, previous, prior             The way the program works is this: one uses the cursor to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are desired.  It is similar, in principle, to finding a synonym in a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonyms to find them.  I am not sure why, but I expected the program to “network” in the same way.  However, when I highlighted antecedent , what appeared on the screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent missing, and preceding had reappeared.  If all this is too complicated to follow, let me summarize: you look up word X and get synonyms A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.  You look up the synonyms for word A, and you get synonyms X, B, C, D, E, F, and G.  Even the definition provided for the sub-listings is identical in wording to that of the word originally sought.             This is very economical of space and involves a clever computer ploy, but it does not provide a particularly useful synonym dictionary, for, as we all know, synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative law of mathematics; in language, “Things equal to the same thing are not (necessarily) equal to each other.”  Perhaps the Proximity people thought that they had got round that little problem by giving the same definition for each of the items in the list; but we know that only very rarely are two synonyms bi-unique (which is another way of saying that if A = B, B does not necessarily always equal A), an ineluctable fact of language.             If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary is likely to be of use, then this package may be of service.  It works with a hard disk or with a set of floppies and can be used with 29 popular word-processing programs.  (That was the number listed when I received my copy; it might have increased.)  It also has a few neat features, like suggesting a few alternatives if you happen to think that preceding is spelt “preceeding” (as many people do).  It has a useful “Help” feature that can be called upon at any stage.  Also, if you enter jump , you get the synonyms for that; but if you enter jumped , you get the (same) synonyms but inflected—including the variants leapt, leaped for leap . All in all, for a relatively primitive system, it is not too bad; but you would have to be in love with your computer to use it in preference to a far more complete books of synonyms available (especially The Synonym Finder , Rodale in the U.S. and Canada, Longman elsewhere, which offers more than 800,000 synonyms, more than three times the number listed in any other synonym book).             The blurb on this book/disk package reads, “Supplies you with 470,000 true synonyms for 40,000 entries.” My guess is that such a quantity might be reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations; in reality, though, there are probably far fewer actual words.  Readers can judge for themselves the validity of this numerical legerdemain.             Laurence Urdang             Family Words             In 1962, American Speech published “Family Words in English,” by Allen Walker Read, which was reprinted in VERBATIM Vol. I, No. 4, (1975).  The article is a classic, probably the first on the subject to appear in a scholarly journal, though there are other informal references to family language, some of which are documented by Dickson in his Bibliography.             Family words and expressions crop up everywhere. Some are quite unique and their reporters cannot imagine their origin; others, like Penn Station , “what one family terms a child's misinterpretation of a famous line or phrase,” are clear: the generic term comes from the Lord's Prayer—“And lead us not into Penn Station.”  Obviously, that works only for kids familiar with New York City.  Other Penn Stations : Our Father, which art in heaven, Harold be Thy name. Land where the Pilgrims pried. Bells on cocktails ring. I pledge my allowance to the flag. Gladly the cross-eyed bear Onward Christian Soldiers, Marching as to War, With the cross-eyed Jesus, Leaning on the phone. ...One nation, invisible... ...One nation, in a vegetable...             Many people know F.H.B. for `family hold back,' an exhortation ensuring ample provender for guests.             This is not to suggest that Dickson's book is a catalogue of bloopers, or what Amsel Greene (and Jack Smith) like to call pullet surprises .  There are many interesting entries in Family Words which, as far as I know, is the first documentation of the genre. There are occasional hidden entries, as the list of diseases—among them the dread mohogus —under the entry for Fowlenzia .  (In the VERBATIM family, some suffer from Fowler's pip , an affliction affecting language fanatics who base a slavish purism on a literal interpretation of Modern English Usage .)                Family Words is useful and fun.  Inevitably, some of the entries are more imaginative than others; Dickson will have his hands full if everyone responds giving private words.

Laurence Urdang             A Midwesterner, Will Hays, Jr., who is proud of his knowledge of post-Civil-War history, tells me the following origin of shot , as in shotglass , absent from “Gunning for the English Language”:             Although we associate trench warfare with World War I, trenches were characteristic also of the Civil War.  A scaffold was built so that a rifleman— who fired a single-shot, muzzle-loading shoulder weapon—could step up and shoot over the top of the trench.  The soldier in charge would command, after each firing, that the rank on the scaffold step down and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded, thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire.             That war, like others, produced disgruntled veterans and those more adventurous or more restless after military service.  They moved westward to start a new life.  The population increased markedly, with corresponding demands for goods and services, among them the need for saloons.  Most new saloons were small and the bars short, accommodating with difficulty the many bunched up, in ranks, if you will, calling for whiskey.  Many of the thirsty crowd were veterans, as were many of the bartenders.  Thus, “Step down (or back) and give me a shot” was readily understood.  I've not been able to corroborate this explanation, but I'll never forget it.             Mr. Joseph Hymes' “Do Mistake—Learn Better” [XV,1] brought to mind the time a Japanese acquaintance told me of a friend of hers who decided to tackle the original English version of three books she had enjoyed while in Japan.  She boldly marched into a bookstore and asked the salesclerk for a copy each of Hemingway's The Sun Come Up Again and Throw Away the Gun and Steinbeck's The Angry Grape .  Is there a term for the errors that creep in while translating a passage back into the original tongue?             Mr. Davidson's observations on the Scottishness of Chambers 20th Century Dictionary [XV,1] bear out my own formed over sixteen years of using one.  An odd sidelight on this came a few days after reading the article.  Definitions under pet end with “Petting Party (coll.) a gathering for the purpose of caressing as an organised sport.  (Origin unknown; not from Gaelic)” I think it hardly fanciful to discern a note of Calvinist disapproval in this curt disclaimer.             Although I greatly enjoyed Richard Lederer's article, I fear that one of his paragraphs is a load of brass monkey balls.             The monkey on board ship was a lad employed to fetch supplies—powder and so forth—to the guns.  The word might also have been used for a receptacle near the guns where powder and balls were kept.  However, this receptacle would have taken the form of a wooden box or something similar.  The idea of a metal stand carrying a pyramid of cannon balls so delicately balanced as to be affected by the tiny differential expansion of brass and iron does not bear thinking about in a heavy sea.             So what is the explanation of the phrase cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey ?  Well, the obvious one, I believe.  Anybody who asks “Why a brass monkey?” is probably not aware that brass monkeys were very common household ornaments in England in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Originally, they were probably imported from India, but were later mass-produced in places such as Birmingham to grace Victorian and Edwardian mantelshelves.  They can still be found today in so-called “gift shops.”  Usually, they come in sets of three, one with its hands over its eyes, one over its ears, and one over its mouth: they were said to represent “See no evil, Hear no evil, Speak no evil.”  There were various whimsical variants.             I am sure I am not the first to point out Joseph Hynes's, “Do Mistake—Learn Better,” [XV,1] mistakes in Japanizing English words, e.g., sei fu not “safe-o,” nain not “nine-o.”  The possibilities for representing English with a language of only forty-seven syllables are not that numerous, and the rules are very consistent. The main problems are representing consonant clusters and word-final consonants.  These difficulties produce such monstrosities as sutoraike for English `strike'—one syllable in English, five in Japanese.             Every Japan veteran has his list of favorite mistakes. Mine are the ones that are possible, but wrong, English.  Adding the Japanese final vowels produces Gone with the Windo .  Hypercorrection, where Japanese speakers learn that many final vowels do not exist in the American version of the tongue and so remove them, sometimes incorrectly, gives us the California cities of San Francisk and Sacrament .  This process resulted in the sign reading Pizz and Coffee .             My absolute favorite of these semantic mistakes, however, does not come from the problem of sound. Japanese has a verb inflection which expresses causation or permission—in English, “to make someone or to let someone do something.”  One day during a university English class, a very discomfited student, after frantic and obtrusive dictionary work, handed a colleague of mine a scrap of paper.  On it was written this sentence: “Please make me go to the bathroom.”             You Could Look It Up             As everyone in the world must know by now, William Safire writes a column in The New York Times Magazine called “On Language.”  Considering the circulation of The New York Times on Sundays, his column is probably the most widely read commentary on contemporary English in the world; that places more than one uncommon burden on a writer: he must do his utmost to be accurate; he must try to select subjects likely to be of interest to his readers; and he must write well.             Those familiar with Safire's editorial style, reflected in his political columns on the editorial pages of The N. Y. Times , may agree with me in the contention that when he writes about language he seems to be writing on his day off: I cannot put my finger on why, but “On Language” always strikes me as an excruciating effort to be cute.  In part, that is attributable to the designation of his correspondents, who keep him informed on language that is not within earshot, as the “Lexicographic Irregulars,” an amusing reference the first time or two it was used but now beginning to cloy.  More often than it might prove of interest to me, personally, Safire deals with insiders' language in Washington (where he is based) or with trivialities uttered by some politico.             As Andrew Norman wrote, in a letter published in this book on page 113, “You flit freely back and forth between prescriptivism and descriptivism.”  But are not many of us guilty of that?  We are descriptive of the usages we accept and prescriptive—perhaps proscriptive would be more descriptive—of those we do not like.  At least Safire expresses an opinion; whether the reader agrees with him is another matter, as are the questions of his accuracy, which arise fairly often, and that of the suitability of his style, which, as far as I know, has not been broached before.  It ill behooves me, excoriated recently as enamored of the “cheap larf,” to criticize Safire's arch puns, which permeate—“enliven” is probably the word his editor would use—his articles, but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable for reading, however they might evoke a chuckle when uttered viva voce .  A handful of examples, from the book at hand: Therefore, I stand uncorrected. [p. 112] ...“Get your hand off my knee.”  (That's a mnemonic, pronounced knee-MONIC.) Ize Right?  [title, p. 114] Juggernaughty but Nice [title, p. 115] ...slanguist...[p. 116] Lex Appeal [title, p. 121] Logue-Rolling [title, p. 123] [on -logue vs. -log:] Some people prefer their logues sawed off...[p. 123] But the Library of Congress wants to be non-U [in its spelling of -logue words].  [ibid.]             Writing containing such labored figures makes for hard reading.  I am interested in what Safire has to say about language but find myself stymied: I get the feeling that he has deliberately created a minefield of interruptions in thought through which I must pick my way to the end.  Notwithstanding the valuable role he plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language and in informing them about myriad facets of the subject, I find it hard slogging (or, as he would probably write, “sloguing”).                You Could Look It Up is the umpteenth collection of Safire's columns and, like the previous collections, contains a selection of letters from readers.  It is those that are so sorely missed in his column.  True, there is an occasional mention in his column of a point raised by a correspondent, and the Letters section of the Magazine prints a comment from time to time, but an important feature of the books is their inclusion of far more writer-reader interaction than one might suspect from reading the column alone.  For one thing, the letter-writers call attention to errors or misinterpretations and are largely critical.  Safire cannot be accused of being copy-proud (except, evidently, of awful puns, as in “ Ms. is deliberately msterious , but at least it is not deliberately msleading ” and other mscegenations).             There is no gainsaying that Safire is one of the most influential writers on contemporary English, and it is essential that his books be in the libraries of all who are interested in the subject, regardless of their alignment with his opinions.  For one thing, he documents many neologisms, an activity that endears him to many working lexicographers.  From the sometimes cavalier manner in which he treats his subject, one wonders if Safire feels the burden of the responsibility he has toward his readers.             The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from which this review was prepared; unfortunately, there was no proof of an index, but the publisher has assured me that there will be one in the published book, a rather essential ingredient of a work with this title.             Laurence Urdang             Webster's New World Guide to Current American Usage             Here is a commonsense style book, useful to those who have the education and common sense to be in doubt about questions of English usage.  It has some problems, if you want to be sticky about things: on p. xv we read: ...Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity does not say that E = MC² and in leap year MC³.             Indeed it does not.  But it does say E = mc² ; the version with the capital M and C is, essentially, meaningless to those familiar with the conventional symbolism used in physics.             While I acknowledge that it is not easy to know how to sort out the many topics to be covered in a usage book, most reasonable writers have taken a stab at writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely place to look, then have provided a detailed index.  Not Bernice Randall.  True, one can find different from , etc., in an entry so headed, but for absolute constructions one is referred to an entry called “Covered with onions, relish, and ketchup, I ate a hotdog at the ball-park.” If the user wants to find out about misplaced adjectives and adverbs , reference is made to the entry “Electric shaver for women with delicate floral design on the handle.”  A search for only would be futile.             Perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need some lightening up, but I am hard put to agree that they are quite as frivolous and light-headed as this book would have us believe.  Fun is fun, but those who might rely on such a book are quite serious about the information they are seeking, and it is unfair to play fast and loose with their sincerity.  A sense of humor about a subject is born of a feeling of security about it, but security is the one characteristic often lacking among those who would use Current American Usage .             There is no doubt that Randall enjoys her work. But of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms?  And of what use are the interminable examples, for instance, of the misuse of like for as , which draw out the entry to three pages?  More than four pages are devoted to clichés (under the guise of “Lo and behold, it's man's best friend.,” which, being an exclamation, really ought to end in an exclamation point).  The article on British/American English (“There's no home like Eaton Place.”) is a good one, but, at six pages, its utility is questionable.  In the matter of pronunciations of BrEng names, it is an old-fashioned fantasy of Americans that Brits go round saying POM-frit for Pontefract : most Brits that I have heard give the name a spelling pronunciation these days; and so with many of the old shibboleths.  Of what relevance (to usage, notwithstanding the fact that the topic is interesting) is an entry on eponyms (“John Bull and John Hancock are not just any johns.”)?  That is not, strictly speaking, a subject pertinent to the title of the book.             All of which is to say that the book is an interesting work on the language and contains accurate, though longwinded information about what it covers, “interesting and useful facts about American English.” Its only real faults are its title, which belies the content, the cutesy headings, and the lack of a truly detailed index: self-indexing does not provide coverage of sufficient detail.  As a reference work on usage, it is far from complete: The Simon and Schuster Publicity Department could have used an entry on foreword/ forward (spelt “foreward” in the release accompanying the review copy).             A longish section, “Some Troublesome Idiomatic Prepositions,” and a “Glossary of Grammatical and Linguistic Terms Used in This Book,” followed by a list of “References,” sources associated with specific entries, round out the work.             Laurence Urdang             Language Notes from Abroad             “Once more unto the breach for the warriors of 1'Académie Française in their uphill battle to preserve the purity of their native tongue.  Examples of franglais which they find particularly monstrous are, I hear, to be condemned to a newly created “Musée des horreurs.”  The first is “sponsor, sponsoriser, sponsorisation.” The academy also calls upon all French to send in further examples of “linguistic pollution,” observing ruefully that this is one museum which will be open 12 months a year.  But the savants have passed barman, blazer, bobsleigh , and boycott as fit for inclusion in their new dictionary.”  [From The Times , 15 January 1988]             Letter to the Editor of The Times             Penny Perrick regrets (January 11) that “There is no word in English to describe that particular, special sort of pride that one feels in the achievements of one's children.”  But the verb kvell , which exactly expresses that emotion, is already (like other Yiddish loanwords, such as chutzpah, meshugga and nosh ) to be found in the Supplement to the Oxford-English Dictionary .             If you think that the practice in some Muslim countries of amputating the hand of a thief is harsh, beware of participating in horse shows in England, where there is no capital punishment but the issue arises every few years: A carriage and team of Cleveland Bay horses, driven by Mr Fred Pendlebury...[were] approaching the water obstacle during the cross-country section of the Harrods International Grand Prix when the leading pair became confused, turned back and became entangled with the second pair. Mr Pendlebury, of Smithills, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, was eliminated.             [From The Times , 16 May 1988]             Loose Cannons & Red Herrings             Readers should be familiar with Robert Claiborne's earlier books, especially Our Marvelous Native Tongue: The Life and Times of the English Language . One might say that subtitling the present book “A Book of Lost Metaphors” is an example of a loose canon [sic] — unless metaphor is taken in its broadest sense—but one is unlikely to find red herrings here: the etymologies of a few hundred words and phrases are given, many not readily findable in standard works of reference.  The rationale behind referring to them as “lost” arises from the author's observation of an unfortunate state of affairs: because of an increasingly widespread lack of familiarity with the basic, structural elements of our culture—Greek and Roman mythology, the Bible, literature, and ordinary historical fact—people today are unable to discern the origins of terms like aphrodisiac, Achilles [sic] heel or tendon, meet one's Waterloo, sow dragon's teeth , and hand-writing on the wall , to name a few.  There are many, of course, but unaccountably, they are not the focus of this book.             Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions like sow one's wild oats , about which he tells us little or nothing: the modern Latinate designation Avena fatua came too many centuries after the original expression to have any relevance to it, so why bring up the information that fatua is Latin for `foolish': it was also Latin for `wild,' which might be more to the point.  In any event, it is hard to discern, from the arch style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting, just what is the origin of sow one's wild oats .  In many entries, Claiborne labors the obvious, offering little or nothing we do not already know, could easily imagine, or for which the author offers no explanation. Among examples of the first are spit and polish, on the spot, on the square, stick one's neck out , etc. Examples of the last include spill the beans, square the circle, stalemate , etc.  Between these is an occasional flash of useful wisdom, much of it pretty well covered by other books of this type (which seem to be proliferating).             What is missing, for example, at square the circle , is the information that because the area of a circle is mathematically calculated using pi , which is irrational, there is no mathematical way of calculating the dimensions of a square with the same area as that of a given circle.  But that does not mean that such a square cannot exist.  As for stalemate , which is related to checkmate , would it not have been important to indicate that the - mate part has nothing to do with English, having been borrowed from checkmate which is a loanword from Persian (and has nothing to do with check , either).             Often, an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology and merely explains the meaning.  Does any reader need an entry like this one?                straddle .  When you straddle a horse, you've got one leg on either side of the animal.  When a politican straddles an issue, he's in much the same position.             Some speculative suggestions, as the derivation (or reinforcement) from Seidlitz powders for take a powder are sheer nonsense.  Not all entries contain misleading, dull, or incorrect information, but those that do not are marked by a lack of originality.             Laurence Urdang             Word Maps             Dialect geography, a branch of dialectology, describes certain features of the dialects of a language and their distribution.  The field is about 100 years old. Most prominent among its earliest practitioners in England was Joseph Wright, who prepared the six-volume English Dialect Dictionary , which was published between 1898 and 1905; the best-known contemporary British specialist is Harold Orton.  In America, work proceeded space during the 1930s, largely under the direction of Raven McDavid, Hans Kurath, and, later, Harold Allen; more recently, Lee Pedersen and others have investigated American English dialects. Between 1948 and 1961, fieldworkers based at the University of Leeds conducted the Survey of English Dialects, which studied 313 localities in England (which, as everyone ought to know, does not include Wales or Scotland).  The present book is extracted from the two major works that resulted from the Survey, The Linguistic Atlas of England (1978) and A Word Geography of England (1974), both under the direction of Harold Orton, aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the latter effort.             People generally seem to find dialect study interesting. One letter writer to The Times [21 June 1988] reported: Our close neighbour... in Bere Regis, who was born in the village and who speaks with a delicious Dorset burr, always uses “I” instead of “me.”... “Well, it makes company for I and company for she.”  Another of his happy expressions is inner-wards, meaning `since,' as in...“I chucked him out the door and he's not been back innerwards.”             Another reported [same date]: Let's get it right.  The Bristol for “me” is not “I,” but “oi.”  When I was teaching there, the explanation invariably given by boys brought to me for scrapping in the playground was: “Ee it oi, so oi it ee.”             The 100 maps selected for representation from the Survey yield information on several hundred words, some of which are clear variants, others quite different lexical entities.  For instance, Map 34 shows the areas, marked off by boundary lines, where the variants chimley chimbley, chimmock, chimdey, chimbey , and chimney occur.  Map 33 shows the distribution of child (most of southern England) and of bairn (north of a slightly wavy line between Boston, on the Wash to the east, and Lancaster, on the west coast).             The authors have provided a brief introduction which is easy to follow, a list of suggested readings, and the names and addresses of the several institutions and societies in Britain where readers may indulge a more intensive interest in dialect study.  The maps are clear, each occupying a full page, and the word information is well set forth on them.  Where necessary, brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any information that might seem to be out of the ordinary. I have only one nit to pick with the authors.  In their description of isoglosses , they write: These are drawn to run midway between/ localities which were shown by the Survey of English Dialects to use the different words or pronunciations which are the subject of the map.             Although it is true that isoglosses, in effect, set off the various areas where a particular usage was recorded, more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites either where speakers employ both usages or where speakers using one or the other live in very close proximity. Hence, the term isogloss , from iso - `same' + gloss `word,' to describe the line on a map where the terms are of equal distribution.  Isoglosses are to dialect maps what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps, what isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans, etc. The authors are not alone in getting this wrong: it is incorrect in some dictionaries.             In those countries where dialect study is undertaken, dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries: the standardization of terminology as adopted by national periodicals, news services, radio, and television; the establishment of “prestige” dialects and, through the media, their promulgation; and the huge population shifts that have taken place, particularly in the U.S. since WWII. Such shifts have been somewhat slower in England, but seem now to be speeding up.  There are many other, lesser factors at work, but taken together, all tend toward standardization, especially as the older speakers die off.  In some respects, it may not be long before certain aspects of dialect geography will be largely historical.  The importance of dialect is emphasized regularly in the press, where we read about people being killed, as in parts of India, because they use the wrong shibboleths.             This book is a good introduction to the subject (in England); those familiar with dialectology in America, and those interested in the study in England or, indeed, generally would be well advised to add Word Maps to their libraries.             Laurence Urdang             American Literary Almanac             This is an interesting, useful reference book containing information about the better-known writers of America.  It is divided into eighteen chapters varying in length, each dealing with a different aspect of the authors and their works, among them, Writers Related to Writers Schooldays (which colleges and universities spawned which writers) American Literary Pseudonyms American Literary Title Sources Literary Cons: Hoaxes, Frauds, and Plagiarism in American Literature The Profession of Authorship: Authors/Publishers/ Editors/Agents Thrown to the Wolves: Reviews and Reviewers             These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography and a detailed Index.             As can be seen from the chapter headings, some of the material is trivial, but nonetheless interesting for that.  It is not at once apparent why the book is styled an “almanac,” but that is unimportant: there is no other book I know of that contains as much diverse information about American writers as this one.  Its readability and organization make it suitable for browsing—even for reading straight through—so in that respect, at least, it does not resemble books in the “Oxford Companion” series.  It contains many photographs of writers, some quite early; these enliven the appearance of the book but accomplish little else, unless one is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked like at the age of 15 (as a printer's devil) or in the appearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle of a railroad track in Cleveland in 1916.             It is difficult to make any sensible connection between the lives of authors and their creations.  A handful might have led colorful existences, some are objects of interest because they died early, committed suicide, were related to (other) famous people, and so forth; but such information seldom reveals as much about their output as do the creations themselves, and in certain cases one is probably better off not knowing quite so much.             This book appears to have been diligently researched and has much to recommend it as an adjunct to most libraries, public and private, large and small, general and specialized.

another rather closely respects, use different alphabets; early examples, utterly unrecognizable untrained readers modern languages, written cuneiform, quite suitable writing soft clay tablets pointed stylus, hieroglyphics. it would nice think linguists working hard organize languages, working alongside archaeologists providing raw materials. but rarely collaborate and, exceptions, work correlated systematic way. schliemann, discovered site troy, used evidence homer's iliad determine digging site, ruins long since disappeared view. in many places, ancient sites lay buried—and still do—beneath modern cities: modern property owners quite understandably take dim view tearing buildings chance remnants ancient town found several yards below. today, new building erected london, archaeological team examines cleared site archaeological significance. but there, everywhere else, nothing interfere progress and, regardless finds importance, archaeologist must eventually yield bulldozer. notwithstanding, even brief glimpses afforded investigations provide insight civilizations existed hundreds or, cases, thousands years earlier. based sparse evidence available, linguists theorized earlier languages given rise attested. in words, based knew group languages documented, tried imagine language sprang from. in cases, dealt words functional elements, creating called reconstructions hypothetical family prototypes called, variously, proto-latin, proto-greek, proto-germanic, proto-indo-iranian, forth, ultimate goal posit single language called proto-indo-european. that entirely true, linguists know much language suggest ever was, literally, single language indo-european languages descended. nonetheless, convenient think existence group proto-dialects referred proto-indo-european. it seems natural original language, ursprache , posited, next step speculate source, urheimat . that renfrew tried do. essentially, proposes parent indo-european languages born central anatolia, whence spread eastward, westward, northward, modified influences languages came contact, till ultimately emerged recognizable, modern manifestations categorize germanic, hellenic, italic, indo-iranian, anatolian, armenian, celtic, tocharian, albanian, baltoslavic. i quarrel renfrew's theory—notwithstanding generally received wisdom placed homeland north black sea region volga steppes. it difficult nonspecialist reader (like me) assess validity arguments, based contention language (and congeners) carried along spread nomad pastoralism. using evidence available, renfrew contends original indo-european language, closely related hittite, separated 6500 bc, ie languages western europe developing western anatolia iran, india, pakistan eastern division. the choice prevailing theory renfrew's depends whether one accepts “wave” theory, first promulgated hundred years ago johnanes schmidt, german linguist, one indigenous development. pottery finds interpreted support either imposition elite culture turkmenia late development indus civilization. renfrew accepts wave theory, last two thirds archaeology & language sets forth arguments favor. unfortunately, presentation linguistic argument, author clearly treading speculative ground parts dealing outright archaeology, familiar territory, disorganized repetitious. it difficult place blame renfrew, editor

prominent among earliest practitioners england joseph wright, prepared six-volume english dialect dictionary , published 1898 1905; best-known contemporary british specialist harold orton. in america, work proceeded space 1930s, largely direction raven mcdavid, hans kurath, and, later, harold allen; recently, lee pedersen others investigated american english dialects. between 1948 1961, fieldworkers based university leeds conducted survey english dialects, studied 313 localities england (which, everyone ought know, include wales scotland). the present book extracted two major works resulted survey, the linguistic atlas england (1978) a word geography england (1974), direction harold orton, aided sanderson widdowson latter effort. people generally seem find dialect study interesting. one letter writer the times [21 june 1988] reported: our close neighbour... bere regis, born village speaks delicious dorset burr, always uses “i” instead “me.”... “well, makes company i company she.” another happy expressions inner-wards, meaning `since,' in...“i chucked door he's back innerwards.” another reported [same date]: let's get right. the bristol “me” “i,” “oi.” when i

others quite different lexical entities. for instance, map 34 shows areas, marked boundary lines, variants chimley chimbley, chimmock, chimdey, chimbey , chimney occur. map 33 shows distribution child (most southern england) bairn (north slightly wavy line boston, wash east, lancaster, west coast). the authors provided brief introduction easy follow, list suggested readings, names addresses several

maps oceans, etc. the authors alone getting wrong: incorrect dictionaries. in countries dialect study undertaken, dialectologists observe today many factors militating strict maintenance older dialect boundaries: standardization terminology adopted national periodicals, news services, radio, television; establishment “prestige” dialects and, media, promulgation; huge population shifts taken place, particularly u.s. since wwii. such shifts somewhat slower england, seem speeding up. there many other, lesser factors work, taken together, tend toward standardization, especially older speakers die

We've worked hard to       structrue the organization so that we've ready to move boldly into the       next century, and I believe that we have an exciting and successful       future ahead of us.       One of the areas we've decided to focus on is development. It's clear       that if we don't increase our base of private funding, we won't have the       kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers       and the very important services they offer. In 1998, CCI served 31,484       individuals right in their own backyards. Where else would that many       people turn if CCI weren't there to help?       The community initiatives committee is working with our development       office to put together a long-range fundraising plan that will ultimately       bring more money into our centers. This in turn will help us to increase       and even improve the services we offer.       With this in mind, I am asking each one of you to make a personal       contribution of $50, $100 or even $1,000 to show that you believe in the       work that we do and are willing to support it with both your time and       your finances. This way when we go out to ask for community support and       are asked about our board giving level, we can show our in-house       commitment through 100% board participation. I also encourage you to seek       additional support through your company, church, or service       organization.       I know that our staff and committee members will be happy to go with       you to talk to these group if you need their help. We're at an exciting       juncture and it won't be long until we start seeing solid results from       our efforts. Your financial support of the development process is just       one step in making CCI a stronger, more efficient and ultimately more       effective federation of service providers. Please, make your contribution       today.       Sincerely,       J.Chris Graffeo Chair       P.S.

pmed.0010029.txt,"        There is a much-quoted saying, attributed to the epidemiologist Geoffrey Rose: “A large         number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases than a small number         exposed to a very high risk.” This is true for many individual risk factors such as salt         intake (linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease) and speeding on the         highway (linked to injuries and accidents). Does it apply to many other global health         risks? The study by Anthony Rodgers and colleagues suggests that it does.         To develop effective health policies, one must understand the existing health risks and         disease burdens. On a worldwide scale, this is a tough challenge. The Global Burden of         Disease Database, maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), collects data from         countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco, malnutrition, childhood abuse,         unsafe sex, childbirth, and cholesterol levels, as well as on disease burdens, for example         depression, blindness, and diarrhea. A large group of scientists from all over the world         has developed a framework to analyze these data. To compare different risks or burdens,         they calculate disability-adjusted life-years, or DALYs—the number of healthy life years         lost because of a particular disease or risk factor.         Rodgers and colleagues used data from the WHO database for 26 risk factors and from 14         epidemiological subregions of the world to calculate the proportion of         risk-factor-attributable disease burden in different population subgroups defined by age,         sex, and exposure level. For being underweight in childhood, for example—the leading risk         factor for global loss of healthy life—they found that only 35% of the disease burden         occurred in severely underweight children, the rest occurred in those only moderately         underweight. The relative risks for the moderately underweight are much lower, but the         number of children in that category is so large that the total attributable burden amounted         to almost two-thirds of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor.         The analysis confirms—and extends to a global level—previous research showing that many         major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels, not just among         individuals exposed to high levels of risk. It also points to risk factors that are         particularly prevalent among specific populations and age groups, and for which highly         targeted interventions could be effective.         Despite numerous caveats and limitations of studies like this one, such analyses are         essential aids in guiding the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life         years lost to premature death and disability.",14,412,2908,5.44,145,"there much-quoted saying, attributed epidemiologist geoffrey rose: “a large number people exposed small risk may generate many cases small number exposed high risk.” this true many individual risk factors salt intake (linked high blood pressure cardiovascular disease) speeding highway (linked injuries accidents). does apply many global health risks? the study anthony rodgers colleagues suggests does. to develop effective health policies, one must understand existing health risks disease burdens. on worldwide scale, tough challenge. the global burden disease database, maintained world health organization (who), collects data countries around world risk factors tobacco, malnutrition, childhood abuse, unsafe sex, childbirth, cholesterol levels, well disease burdens, example depression, blindness, diarrhea. a large group scientists world developed framework analyze data. to compare different risks burdens, calculate disability-adjusted life-years, dalys—the number healthy life years lost particular disease risk factor. rodgers colleagues used data who database 26 risk factors 14 epidemiological subregions world calculate proportion risk-factor-attributable disease burden different population subgroups defined age, sex, exposure level. for underweight childhood, example—the leading risk factor global loss healthy life—they found 35% disease burden occurred severely underweight children, rest occurred moderately underweight. the relative risks moderately underweight much lower, number children category large total attributable burden amounted almost two-thirds total global burden disease risk factor. the analysis confirms—and extends global level—previous research showing many major health risks important across range exposure levels, among individuals exposed high levels risk. it also points risk factors particularly prevalent among specific populations age groups, highly targeted interventions could effective. despite numerous caveats limitations studies like one, analyses essential aids guiding distribution limited funds lower burden life years lost premature death disability.",6,4,there much quoted saying attributed epidemiologist geoffrey rose a large number people exposed small risk may generate many cases small number exposed high risk this true many individual risk factors salt intake linked high blood pressure cardiovascular disease speeding highway linked injuries accidents does apply many global health risks the study anthony rodgers colleagues suggests does to develop effective health policies one must understand existing health risks disease burdens on worldwide scale tough challenge the global burden disease database maintained world health organization who collects data countries around world risk factors tobacco malnutrition childhood abuse unsafe sex childbirth cholesterol levels well disease burdens example depression blindness diarrhea a large group scientists world developed framework analyze data to compare different risks burdens calculate disability adjusted life years dalys the number healthy life years lost particular disease risk factor rodgers colleagues used data who database 26 risk factors 14 epidemiological subregions world calculate proportion risk factor attributable disease burden different population subgroups defined age sex exposure level for underweight childhood example the leading risk factor global loss healthy life they found 35 disease burden occurred severely underweight children rest occurred moderately underweight the relative risks moderately underweight much lower number children category large total attributable burden amounted almost two thirds total global burden disease risk factor the analysis confirms and extends global level previous research showing many major health risks important across range exposure levels among individuals exposed high levels risk it also points risk factors particularly prevalent among specific populations age groups highly targeted interventions could effective despite numerous caveats limitations studies like one analyses essential aids guiding distribution limited funds lower burden life years lost premature death disability
HistoryJerusalem.txt,"        A Brief History         Jerusalem’s recorded history begins with its mention in         Egyptian court records 4,000 years ago, but there had been human         settlements here for centuries, probably millennia, before that. At the         beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite         mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route, far less important than         biblical cities such as Hazor, Megiddo, Beth Shean, and Shechem. The         earliest name associated with the city, Ur usalim, perhaps meant “city         of Shalim” or “founded by Shalim. ” Scholars speculate that Shalim         might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace, for the name         resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for “peace”: shalom and         salaam, respectively. If true, this is an ironic name for a city that         would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places         on the face of the earth.         Biblical Jerusalem         In the Bible, Genesis 14:18–20 records that Abraham visited         the city of “Salem” in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the         city’s ruler, Melchzedik, who offered him bread and wine. The city is         not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet         warrior, King David, who captured the city from the Jebusites in about         1000 b.c. The Bible describes how David’s soldiers conquered Jerusalem         by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the         city by surprise. Warren’s Shaft, part of a Canaanite water system         discovered by 19th-century archaeologists and open to visitors, might         be the very tunnel infiltrated by David’s army.         Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not         allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel, David made it the         capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented         artisans, dedicated priests, magical poets and musicians, and the most         formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city. He         also brought the Ark of the Covenant, the portable tabernacle         containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai, to the         Spring of Gihon, just outside the walls of Jerusalem. There the Ark         rested until it was placed in the Temple, built in approximately 960         b.c. on Mt. Moriah, the high point at the northern end of the city.         The Temple (today known as the “First” Temple) was completed         by David’s son and successor, King Solomon. According to biblical         tradition, although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully         assembled its building materials, he was deemed unworthy of         constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his         hands. At the Temple’s dedication, Solomon addressed his God: “... the         Heavens, even the Heaven of the Heavens, cannot contain Thee; how much         less this House that I have built? ”         The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt.         Moriah, on which it stood, where Abraham was called to sacrifice his         son Isaac. Along with this splendid house of worship, Solomon built a         royal palace, mansions for his wives, temples for the foreign gods         worshipped by the princesses he had married, and towers for the defense         of the capital. Under the wise reign of Solomon, the city flourished as         the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea         and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia. The Temple and         royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with         cedar from Lebanon; the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon         have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years. But with         his death the empire collapsed, and the Israelite kingdom was divided         into two separate, impoverished, often warring nations: Israel, with         its capital at Shechem in the north, ruled by a series of northern         dynasties; and the smaller kingdom of Judah, with its capital at         Jerusalem, from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule. The Bible         tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms         aroused the fury of the great Prophets.         In 701 b.c. the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed         Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem. Thanks to King         Hezekiah’s hidden water tunnel, the city narrowly escaped destruction.         The end of David’s dynasty came in 587 b.c. , when Nebuchadnezzar, King         of Babylon, invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem. When it fell, the         Temple and all the buildings were burned. The people of the         once-glorious city were forced into an exile known as “the Babylonian         Captivity. ”         In time, the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the         Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b.c. The city         was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians, but rebuilding         was slow work. The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. , but much of         the city still lay in ruins.         Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in         332 b.c. under Alexander the Great and, subsequently, to his         Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian         Seleucids. When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism, Jews led by Judah         Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b.c. and, against         all odds, restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem.         The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of         pagan sacrifices; the eight-day celebration of Hanukkah (Feast of         Dedication) commemorates their victory. The Hasmonean dynasty,         descendants of the Maccabee family, ruled an independent Jewish         Commonwealth that stretched from the Negev to the Galilee. Jerusalem         grew, surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside         the Jaffa Gate. The Hasmoneans ruled until Pompey’s Roman legions         arrived in 63 b.c.         Roman Jerusalem         After the initial years of Roman administration and         political infighting, Rome installed Herod (scion of a family from         Idumea, a Jewish kingdom in the desert) as King of Judea. He reigned         from 37 to 4 b.c. , during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall         and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate, the foundation of         which still stand. Several palaces were built and a water system         installed. Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple, making it one of         the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire. The courtyard         around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of         pilgrims, and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made         with great stone blocks. One of these walls, the Western Wall, is today         a major reminder of Jerusalem’s greatness under Herod. A massive         fortress was built overlooking the Temple Mount, which Herod named         “Antonia” in honor of his Roman friend and benefactor, Mark Antony.         For all his accomplishments, Herod was nevertheless hated         by his subjects; he taxed, he tortured, and he ordered the massacre of         male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah.         When Jesus was born in about 4 b.c. , Joseph and Mary escaped Herod’s         paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new-born infant. They returned         to live in the Galilee village of Nazareth, making pilgrimages to         Jerusalem.         According to biblical accounts, Jesus spent his life         ministering in the Galilee Valley. In about a.d. 30 he and his         followers went for Passover to Jerusalem, which was in unrest at this         time, dissatisfied with Roman domination. Jesus’s entry into the Temple         caused a commotion; after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the         temple priests, who were under direct Roman rule. Jesus was put on         trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion, a Roman form of execution         for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals.         In a province rife with rebellion and retaliation, the execution in         Jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the Galilee did not by         itself have an immediate effect on history.         After Jesus’s crucifixion, harsh Roman rule continued until         a.d. 66, when the Jews rebelled. For four years Jewish zealots fought         against the might of Rome. At the end, the Roman general Titus laid         siege to Jerusalem in a.d. 70, finally attacking its starved and         weakened defenders. Those who didn’t escape were executed or sold into         slavery. The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed. The last of the         zealots held out for another three years at Masada (see page 76). Half         a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this         first revolt against Rome, a number unequaled in ancient warfare.         Christian and Islamic Jerusalem         For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins, until the Roman         Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to         Jupiter. In outrage, the Jews began a second revolt against Rome, led         by Simon bar Kochba. The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated,         but, in the end, Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss         of life. The planned new Roman city, Aelia Capitolina, was built over         the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem, and Jews were barred from residing         there for all time. Jerusalem’s physical existence as a spiritual city         seemed finished, but its spiritual power for Jews, and for the         struggling new Christian religion, remained. For the next two centuries         Aelia Capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history.         But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth         century, and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again. Queen         Helena, a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the         Great, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 326 to identify the sites         associated with Jesus’s life. She found that the city’s most beautiful         Roman temple, dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite, stood on the site of         the crucifixion. The temple was demolished and a vast, Classical-style         church was built around Golgotha (the hill where Jesus’s crucifixion         was believed to have taken place). Throughout Jerusalem, other spots         important to Jesus’s life were commemorated with religious structures.         Pilgrims came from all over the Roman (and, later, Byzantine) Empire         during the following centuries, but the prosperity they brought lasted         only until 614, when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced         Jerusalem to rubble again. In 629, Jerusalem was recaptured by the         Byzantines.         Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation,         Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam. The Temple Mount         was identified in Islamic tradition as “the farthest spot” (in Arabic,         el-aksa), the site to which the Prophet Muhammad was transported in one         night from Mecca on a winged horse, as described in the 17th chapter of         the Koran. From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was         permitted to glimpse paradise. The rock on the Temple Mount from which         he ascended, at or close to the site of the ruined Temple, was         commemorated by the construction of the Dome of the Rock in 691. The         Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalem’s most striking monument; it is         counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created. By about 715,         the El-Aksa Mosque, third holiest place of prayer in Islam (after Mecca         and Medina), had been built on the southern side of the Temple Mount.         Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half         centuries. In 1099, under their leaders Godfrey de Bouillon and         Tancred, the Crusaders captured the Holy City for Christendom by         slaughtering both Muslims and Jews.         Crusaders, Mamelukes, and Turks         The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with         Godfrey at its head. They built many impressive churches during the         term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were         driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin. During the         Sixth Crusade (1228– 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed         to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation.         The Christians, however, could not hold the city. After         they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the         Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next         250 years. The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and         invasions. Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was         constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken         their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had         enjoyed in earlier times.         In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was         advancing through the Middle East. Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in         1517, remaining under their control for 400 years. Suleiman the         Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this         day. Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed.         But when Suleiman died, his empire, including Jerusalem, began a long         period of decline. The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th         century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the         destination of thousands of travelers each year.         19th-Century Aspirations         At the same time, many Jews sought religious freedom and         fulfillment by moving to Palestine (as the Holy Land was traditionally         called) and especially to Jerusalem. In the 1890s, Theodor Herzl         (1860–1904) worked to organize a movement, Zionism, to create a Jewish         state. Chaim Weizmann (1874–1952), a scientist born in Russia but later         a British subject, did much to put Herzl’s hopes into practice.         Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British         government that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917, supporting the         idea of a Jewish “national home” in Palestine that also respected the         rights of existing non-Jewish people already living there. The problem         was that British strategists, who were fighting the Ottoman Turks in         1917, had secretly promised the lands to their World War I Arab         allies.         In 1922 the League of Nations granted the British a mandate         to administer Palestine. Jerusalem flourished during the early years of         the Mandate. Modern neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, and the Hebrew         University were built in West Jerusalem, the new Jewish enclave. But         Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine         led to increasing strife; by 1946, Jerusalem was an armed camp. In 1947         the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two         states, one Jewish and one Arab, with Jerusalem as an international         city that belonged to neither. But lacking the means to enforce its         decision, the United Nations was powerless to halt the fighting that         erupted as the British withdrew their troops in 1948.         Modern Israel         The State of Israel was declared during this difficult         time. In response, member states of the Arab League sent troops to help         the Palestinian Arabs. West Jerusalem, separated from the rest of the         new Jewish nation, held out under siege for several months until         Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the         coastal areas. Jews were evacuated from the Old City’s Jewish Quarter,         and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem. As a         result of armistice agreements in 1949, Jerusalem was divided: West         Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control, and East Jerusalem         (including the Old City, with its Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and         Armenian quarters) came under Jordanian authority. Free access to holy         sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice         agreements. However, with the city partitioned by fortifications and         barbed wire, no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the         Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem.         For the next 19 years, Jerusalem was two cities. Political         and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of         terrorism or sniping until the Six Day War in June 1967. Within three         days the city was completely in Israeli hands, and in two weeks it was         physically and administratively reunited. Jerusalem’s mayor, Teddy         Kollek, spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of         development, adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting         neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the         concerns of Jerusalem’s many communities.         Today, as always, Jerusalem is a city of controversies:         religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews; Palestinians calling for         independence; many residents protesting a wave of high-rise development         that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis. But         the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily         special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present-day         Jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world’s attention into the new         millennium.",127,2664,18356,5.12,1028,"a brief history jerusalem’s recorded history begins mention egyptian court records 4,000 years ago, human

We often hear about economic poverty, but what some of       these young people are growing up with is emotional poverty-they have       often given up on hope and the possibility of a successful future. With       your help, we can change that.       Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full       of hope and with a positive outlook. Thanks to our Big Sisters       volunteers, these young people are self-confident, believe in themselves       and are beginning to realize their full potential. A recent study by       Public/Private Ventures (PPV) showed that girls who had a Big Sister for       just one year:       reduced first-time drug use by 46% lowered school absenteeism by 52%       cut violent behavior by 33% enhanced school performance showed improved       peer and family relationships       Former Little Sister Amy, now 18-years old, is a testament to the Big       Sisters program.       ""I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992. Since then, she and       I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new       things. We go to movies, dinner, concerts, and other stuff like that, but       I have also been able to participate in charity events and fundraiser       type things.       Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister, but I learned a       lot from her too. I have become more open-minded, more responsible, and,       most importantly, I have gained a lot more self-confidence. I am very       thankful to the Big Sisters program for allowing me this very special       opportunity.       In 1998, Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many       programs. But the need is still great. Over 170 young people are still       waiting for a mentor.       You are an important part in making sure these young people are       matched with caring adult mentors. Will you make a financial gift to Big       Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the       guidance they need, that more young people stay in school, stay off drugs       and make good choices?       Your contribution will be used to recruit and retain quality       volunteers. It will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that       fosters and supports the development of effective relationships,       including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and       support by a professional staff. This year your gift can go farther!       Gifts of $100 or more will be matched thanks to a special 25th       Anniversary $100,000 Challenge Grant and will be placed in the Growth For       Girls Fund. This fund will support the goal of having 550 mentoring       relationships by the end of 1999 and 1,200 by the end of 2004.

HistoryGreek.txt,"        a brief History         Prehistoric man in Asia Minor (now modern Turkey) or Greece         could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint         silhouette of land. Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that         were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands,         marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring.         Around 7000 b.c. , the Phoenicians set out from what is now         Iran to explore their surroundings. They eventually reached the         islands, and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part         of the Aegean Sea. An important early material, obsidian, was         discovered on the island of Milos. Obsidian is a hard, vitreous         volcanic rock, which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and         stabbing. The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area         remained popular with early travelers.         The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come         together as early as 5000 b.c. , and were already in place by the late         Bronze Age (c. 2700 b.c. ). The major changes were not to daily tasks         and routines, but to the political power base, which changed regularly         and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages.         Cycladic Culture         At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the         Cyclades islands. The distinctive, sculpted marble figures of the era         are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs. You will find         original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the         Cyclades, although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on         Paros. The people farmed and fished; on the dawning of the Bronze Age         in 2700 b.c. , they began to work with metals. The Cycladic culture was         influenced by societies in the east, importing the pottery wheel from         Mesopotamia. They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local         marble.         The Minoans and the Myceneans         Farther south in Crete, the Minoan culture developed after         2000 b.c. into the most significant of its age, spreading its influence         throughout the region by trade and diplomacy. Santorini (Thira), the         next major island north, was heavily influenced by Crete, and the         settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time. The magnificent         frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present, but         the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the         sophistication of the culture here.         Around 1500 b.c. , a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini         destroyed not only Akrotiri — under feet of ash and pumice — but the         whole Minoan civilization. Massive tidal waves swept over Crete, and         other parts of the Mediterranean, smashing buildings and drowning many         thousands of people.         In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the Aegean         Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans (at around 1300         b.c. ), who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland.         The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer, not to         trade. Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by         Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad.         The Rise of Athens         The Dorians, who came overland from northern Europe,         conquered the Mycenaeans. They were a barbaric race, and their custody         of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word         was forgotten and art disappeared. They held sway over islands off the         northern Greek coast, but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea         routes; south of the area, trade continued as usual. At the same time,         city-states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland.         Athens became the most powerful, heralding the start of the classical         Greek period. However, Greece was not yet a country; each city-state         was self-governing and autonomous.         The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean, helped         by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements         such as Carthage, a Greek city on the African coast of the         Mediterranean. Culture and the arts flourished once again. Athletic         prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in 776 b.c.         , to promote friendly competition. Homer wrote his epic works on Chios;         and lyrical poetry was much admired, particularly the work of the poets         Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos.         The preeminent islands of this era were Delos, a sacred         island and center of religion ruled by Athens; Samos, ruled by the         tyrant Polycrates; and Naxos, whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major         building projects. Archaeology shows that, during this time, societies         lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement         inland.         The Persian Wars         As Athens rose in influence and power in the West, it was         matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire. From a power         base in Anatolia, the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and         set their sights on the Cyclades. In 490 b.c. , they captured sacred         Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos. The island communities were         undecided about which side to back for a time. Paros and Andros         contributed to the Persian armory, while others supported Athens. The         two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and         Salamis in 480 b.c. The Persians were defeated, and Athens duly         punished the islands that had turned against it.         Following its victory, Athens introduced the concept of a         mutual protection alliance (a kind of NATO of the ancient world).         Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together, and         created a treasury to fund their plans, which was held on the island of         Delos. The alliance became known as the Delian League. Although there         were minor internal wrangles, the league controlled the Aegean and the         greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b.c. Later, in         454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were         used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and         temples of the Classical Age.         In 431 b.c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and         league member Sparta. Although the islands saw little action, as the         war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power.         Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already         transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by Philip II         of Macedon. He was followed in 336 b.c. by his son Alexander the Great,         one of the most remarkable leaders in history. His rise to power         ushered in the Hellenistic period.         Hellenistic and Roman Periods         When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east         as India, the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes.         Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire. Following         Alexander’s death, his lands were divided among his generals. Much of         the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies, along with Egypt.         Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan.         Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and         successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands,         the next major power change brought influence from the West. The Greek         Hellenistic Empire was gradually, and peacefully, absorbed into the         Roman Empire.         The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity         The Romans ruled a pagan empire, but the Aegean had an         important influence on the early development of Christianity. In a.d.           95, St. John arrived on Patmos, a small rocky island in the Dodecanese,         as a political prisoner. It was here that he wrote what was to become         the final book of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation. It wasn’t         until a.d. 330, however, when the newly converted Emperor Constantine         made Byzantium, renamed Constantinople, capital of his Eastern Empire         that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek         life.         The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified         cities, but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by         waves of invaders. In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen         Muslims, a new potent religious force from the East, the Byzantine army         forcefully enlisted the men of the islands. Disease took a further         toll. By the time of the Crusades, many of the Aegean islands had been         practically depopulated.         As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first         millennium, Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter         the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith.         Unfortunately, their zeal was not matched by their discrimination. The         crusaders swept through the l;and of Byzantium slaughtering Christians         as well as Muslims, civilians as well as soldiers. Constantinople was         taken by Crusader forces in 1204, and they stripped the city of manyof         its finest treasures — which now grace the public buildings of         Venice — although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was         transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell.         While Byzantine land was being divided, there was no one in         control of the seas, so pirates raided towns on many of the islands. To         counter this, the populations moved from their homes on the coast and         built settlements inland, out of sight of the raiding parties. This         created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port         (skala) which serves an inland settlement or chora, making it easier to         protect the island from attack.         The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful         European noblemen, many of whom were Genoese or Venetian, such as Marco         Sanudo on Naxos. The noblemen had free rein to create their own         fiefdoms. The Venetians fortified their main towns — Naxos Town and         Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this — creating labyrinths of         narrow alleys and cul-de-sacs that were designed to confuse and to         demoralize invaders. The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean         Islands, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and         trade.         After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309,         Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land. The Knights of St.         John, a holy military force, made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the         Dodecanese. They began the process of building their strong citadels,         and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands. However, they had         not seen the last of their Muslim foe. A force was gaining strength in         the east to threaten their new bases.         The Coming of the Ottoman Turks         The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east,         taking land in what is now Turkey. By the end of the 13th century, they         began their first raids on the Aegean Islands. In 1453, they took         Constantinople, and immediately made it their capital, renaming it         Istanbul.         They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of         St. John and, after an unsuccessful siege in 1480, they finally ejected         the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522. In 1566, they wrested Chios         from the Genoese, bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands,         but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or         more — Tinos was the last to fall in 1715. The Ottomans brought new         influences to the islands that they controlled, forming a large empire         that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean.         Toward Greek Independence         However, a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula         against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state. In 1770,         Russia came to aid the Greeks (defined by their Orthodox religion         rather than by historical geographical boundaries), declaring war on         the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774.         Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of         Antiparos.         Although this attempt was unsuccessful, the campaign for a         Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in         strength. The Aegean Islands played their part. Lesvos, Chios, and         Samos lay in the important shipping lanes, and patriots began         disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic. In return, the Turks violently put         down every insurrection, including the massacre on Chios, when 22,000         people were slaughtered.         The Ottoman Empire was weakening, however, and in 1821, the         peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time.         The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this         new state. A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout         the Aegean, thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the         disparate Orthodox populations.         The Twentieth Century         A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the         20th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire. The         Turks lost a short war with Italy, and were forced to relinquish the         Dodecanese islands to the Italians. Greece took this opportunity to         absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add         Macedonia to its mainland territories.         Following this debacle, the Ottomans then allied themselves         to Germany in the World War I, losing more territory with the defeat of         the Germans in that war. Greece was handed a strip of land along the         western coast of Asia Minor, which for over 2,000 years had had a         substantial Greek population. Greece moved in to administer the land,         but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part         of greater Greece.         In 1923, Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers,         and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support. He         promised a modern state for his people, but as the situation became         volatile, civil strife broke out in Turkish cities, and those         considered Greek were victims of threats and violence. Many had to         leave their birthplaces, fleeing to Lesvos, Chios, and Samos, the         Greek-ruled islands just offshore. Thousands of people arrived with         little more than the clothes they wore, putting great strain on the         resources of the islands. Finally, Greece was ousted from its new         territory in Asia Minor, which became part of the new Turkish         state.         Greece attempted to stay out of World War II, but Mussolini         saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire. His forces made         a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands,         including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town, but         they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population         against them. Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the         islands.         After the war, in 1949, the Dodecanese islands finally         became part of the Greek nation. But the country was politically         fragmented, with arguments between monarchists and republicans, right         and left, and tension escalated into civil war. The struggle bypassed         most of the islands, although there was fierce fighting on Samos. Even         after the fighting stopped more than a decade later, the country was         not stable.         At the same time, the massive growth in air and road         transport saw shipping decline in importance. The Aegean Islands, which         for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes, became         the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of         several islands came close to collapse.         In 1967, the military took the reins of power in Athens,         and until 1974, the “Colonels” held sway with a repressive and brutal         regime. Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty         and terror, and many made new homes in the United States and Australia.         The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism, and Greece         along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern         Europeans escaping their damp, cool summers.         In 1982, Greece joined the European Common Market (now the         European Union). Since this time, membership has been of great monetary         benefit to the country. The EU has given large subsidies to develop         Greece’s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient         monuments.         Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands,         and road systems have been expanded and im proved. Private investment         has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible.         Politically, the 1990s have been relatively quite times for         the islands, although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas         Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused         consternation within conservative Greek society.         As the Balkans flared to war once again, Greek nationalism         has stirred, and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the         land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers. Whether         this will ever happen remains to be seen, but perhaps the aid offered         by Greece to Turkey after 1999’s devastating earthquake is a sign that         the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to         diminish.",145,2726,18575,5.02,1072,"brief history prehistoric man asia minor (now modern turkey) greece could look across aegean toward horizon see

ch5.txt,"               A Physics of Semantics?                Each of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory.                Each is tentative and incomplete, pointing but not fully adequate.                Yet, I persistently hope, it is better to light one candle against...what? the darkness? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before?                There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics.                We are on shaky ground.                Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found.                We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent, able to manipulate the universe on its own behalfthe egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady, powerful flight.                The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom, and perhaps more than the vaunted quark.                But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom ""intentionality"" and ""purpose"" are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties.                If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more, a properdefinition of life itself, then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where ""purpose"" is ascribed by all of us to one another.                Semantics enters with purpose.                For this to be true, it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose, say, the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient, be conscious.                I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful, an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle, now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work, then do extract work, propagating work and constraint construction, from their environment.                Know-how                Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now, plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material.                I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had, individually and collectively, the embodied know-how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world.                Indeed, as I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents.                Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of ""jobs"" that were widely filled, the abundant niches of the bio-sphere.                There is in this whole self-constructing system a wider know-how, beyond the know-how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment.                Yet, clearly, the know-how is distributed.                There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.                What in the world is ""know-how""?                Philosophers distinguish between ""know-how"" and ""know that.""                I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums.                ""Know that"" concerns propositions, most conveniently, human propositions.                I know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese.                I know that the earth circles the sun, that the earth is roughly spherical, that chairs are used to sit on.                ""Know that"" brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world.                Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can ""know that"" with respect to propositions.                Unlike ""know that,"" ""know-how"" does not involve propositions about the world.                ""Know-how"" involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world.                The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest, the athletic genius high jumping, have the know-how to do it.                Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world?                I certainly want to say yes, without attributing consciousness in any way.                Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes, metabolic switching, mechanical twitching, sensing of glucose gradient, swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations.                It knows how all right, even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business.                But then, try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention.                Thank God for know-how.                Know that is a thin veneer on a four-billion-year-old know-how skill abundant in the biosphere.                But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how.                If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.                The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents.                The know-how is not outside that propagating organization.                The know-how is the propagating organization.                Semantics                All of which brings us, inevitably, to the brink of semantics.                It is simple at its roots, you see.                An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is (i) food; (ii) poison; (iii) a signal; (iv) neutral; (v) something else.                Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view.                The incoming molecule is ""yuck"" or ""yum.""                I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent.                And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind.                If yum, then there will probably be more of this type of agent, osprings of the first.                If yuck, it is not so likely this lineage will prosper.                Once yuck and yum, we are not far from C. S. Pierce's meaning-laden semiotic triad: sign, signified, significans.                Like it or not, the glucose gradient is a sign, a predictor, of ""more glucose that way.""                Granted, the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol, any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain.                In this restricted sense, signs are causally correlated with that which is signified.                By contrast, the relation between the word ""chair"" and that which it signifies, and on which I am now sitting, is arbitrary.                But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view?                If so, can ""mere chemicals"" be signs in the full Piercean sense?                I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words.                Consider first the famous genetic code.                Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein.                The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached, the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids, the binding of the charged transfer RNA's anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet, the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm, tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is ""translated.""                The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules, which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid.                As J. Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site, the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis.                The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site.                Because of this, which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging, plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA.                Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon-codon matching mechanism.                In short, chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations.                It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign, signified, and significans to the genetic code.                It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling, chemical and otherwise, within and between autonomous agents, as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that ""warns"" other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites.                The calculus that is Claude Shannon's elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols.                Nowhere in the core of Shannon's work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning, or semantics, of the information enter.                This is no criticism, and is widely known and appreciated.                There is, however, just a hint of semantics in Shannon's view that the semantics resides in the ""decoder.""                I cannot buy Shannon's view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent.                If not, then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsperhaps a set of water-filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways.                The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding.                But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics.                If only the bacterium could tell us: ""Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me?                I've run into that one before!                I ducked under a boulder, and he never sensed me.                I made it home.                Pass me some more glucose please, Martha.""                I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories, for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and, therefore, cannot deduce that which will unfold.                Thus, among other things, we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds.                Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing.                I too know the risks, including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from ""intentional talk"" to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question.                But patience.                Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold, but we also cannot even translatein the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsfrom legal talk to normal intentional talk, let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound-wave forms monitored and masses at space-time lines as a description.                Then let's just be naive for the moment.                The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agentsay, an early bacteriumis somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world.                The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered, context-dependent set of causal implications of the event, or signal, in question.                ""For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the horse was lost; and for want of the horse, the rider was lost,"" more or less, said Benjamin Franklin.                The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.                It seems hard to ascribe purpose, in the sense of acting on its own behalf, to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga.                Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological.                After all, I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment, defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf, then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf.                Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf.                My definition is a definitional circle.                On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin's ""natural selection"" and ""fitness,"" that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world.                Stones and chairs are not, by my definition, autonomous agents.                All living cells are.                And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf.                Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest.                In short, once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.                Knowing                What about ""knowing""?                Daniel Dennett, in his fine book Darwin's Dangerous Idea , advances a hierarchy of forms of ""knowing,"" if I may use that term, that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means.                I find his hierarchy congenial and informative.                Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher-order entities via variation and natural selection.                I do not disagree, although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution.                Here, in Investigations , I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy, detect those sources of energy, create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy, and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further.                I wonder, in short, at the naturalness and self-generaticity of Dennett's cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres, perhaps planetary geologies, and beyond.                But back to the past.                Dennett distinguishes ""Darwinian creatures,"" ""Pavlovian creatures,"" ""Popperian creatures,"" and ""Gregorian creatures.""                A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature.                In its simplest version, the creature evolves by mutation, also recombination and natural selection.                For the moment, no behavioral learning is to be considered.                So one (or a colony or an ecosystem) of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us.                At the next level up, say, aplysia, a nervous system is present, and the creature is capable of stimulus-response learning, á la Pavlov.                Indeed, aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimulithe later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in ""expectation"" of food.                At the next level (Dennett, perhaps properly, reserves this for us vertebrates) is the Popperian creature.                Popperian creatures, in Dennett's fine phrase, have ""internal models"" of their world and can ""run the internal model"" with the clutch disengaged, rather than running the model in real time in the real world.                This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our ""hypotheses to die in our stead.""                I love that image.                Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creaturenamely, at least humans.                Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives, arrows, digging sticks, machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes.                This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how, and more know that.                Cultural evolution, at some point, begins to burst out-of-bounds.                Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran.                Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom?                Chinese cooking lands in Cuba, and Cuban-Chinese cuisine is invented.                What's next under the sun?                Who can say?                I very much like Dennett's ladder of know-how, and eventual know that.                Without invoking consciousness, not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject, it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems, even without evoking nerve cells.                I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations.                For example, bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already, for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level.                This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter.                As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus, why not envision a complex chemistry, say, very complex carbohydrate-synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves, which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism.                Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self-sustaining web linking the carbohydrates, the enzymes, and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus, then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops.                The image is not too far from how it is imagined that ""idiotype"" and ""anti-idiotype"" immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen.                In such networks, for which there is modestly good evidence, a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences, called the ""idiotype"" of the first antibody.                In turn, the second ""anti-idiotype"" antibody stimulates a third, which stimulates a fourth.                But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody, hence, the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space.                It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system.                Popperian creatures?                Why cannot the molecular-sensing and hypothesis-testing churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor, or not, such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by?                Are nerves necessary?                Plants, as noted, are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade.                There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect, just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified.                Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates.                I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures.                Even here, the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language, wherever new sentences can be created, is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole.                If the conversation we recent two-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another.                I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere, with its urgent diversity in which, emboldened by all our know-how, we do get on with a very rich conversation, may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks.                We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail, I guess.                Smart place, a biosphere, lots to talk about.                Four billion years of yammering.                Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago.                Ethics                And what of ethics?                Does a whiff of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents?                Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent.                There are deep reasons for caution.                Hume told us long ago about the ""naturalistic fallacy"": One cannot deduce ""ought"" from ""is.""                From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued.                From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry, we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so.                Indeed, Hume's injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements.                We scientists find the facts.                You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics.                But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all?                Hume's injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category ""ought.""                The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous.                Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances.                ""It is wrong to kill.""                Becomes, ""Agggah!""                Does the positivist argument seem persuasive?                It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, ""only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful,"" is itself not empirically verifiable.                One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards.                John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all ""contractually"" agree to, were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments.                Thus ""equality before the law"" is one contract that Rawls commends to us.                ""Equality before the law"" is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium.                The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue.                I will content myself with wondering where ""value"" and the rudiments of ""intentionality"" come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts.                Where is the place of value in a world of fact?                So, a short soliloquy.                Facts are know-that statements.                But know-how preceded know that.                While fully aware of Hume's injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent's perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent.                I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria.                Too much yuck, this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere.                Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli , or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around.                And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?                If so, another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid.                Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible.                You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control.                To act ethically, you must first be able to act at all.                But what are ""acts"" in the first place?                Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician.                Now entering Harvard, Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive, after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard, where, at age fourteen, Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands.                Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the ""doings"" of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent.                Note we say the E. coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner.                But all sorts of molecular vibrational, rotational, and translational motions are occurring.                What are actions and what are mere happenings?                I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics.                But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings, Dan's happy phrasing, is relevant for E. coli , tigers, us, trees, and autonomous agents in general.                We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism.                Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise?                Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier, yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics, intentionality, value, and ethics arise with autonomous agents.                I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Hume's naturalistic fallacy.                We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents.",214,4408,30085,5.09,1822,"a physics semantics? each chapters investigations broaches new territory. each tentative incomplete, pointing fully adequate. yet, i persistently hope, better light one candle against...what? darkness? veil beyond framework questions before? there grounds, reasoned best philosophers scientists past several centuries, doubt physics semantics. we shaky ground. yet first hard frost comes, birches swung, crimson leaves scattered carelessly, crystals splint shallow ponds old egrets stand dark watch coming dawn, long-legged, knowing winter thin, first phase transition water ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures flesh concept tiptoe gingerly far side where, perhaps, something new found. we lacked physical definition autonomous agent, able manipulate universe behalfthe egret whose foreboding winter leads lifted wing steady, powerful flight. the egret much part physical reality atom, perhaps vaunted quark. but autonomous agents, daily manipulate world behalf, ""intentionality"" ""purpose"" inevitably attributed common languages, are, definition autonomous agents, also nothing physical systems peculiar organization processes properties. if concept autonomous agents something like usefulor more, properdefinition life itself, autonomous agents span gap merely physical new realm merely physical ""purpose"" ascribed us one another. semantics enters purpose. for true, necessary carriers purpose, say, bacterium heading upstream glucose gradient, conscious. i hope definition autonomous agent useful, autocatalytic system carrying work cycle, rather broadened realization autonomous agents also often detect measure record displacements external systems equilibrium used extract work, extract work, propagating work constraint construction, environment. know-how bring empathetically objectively back three billion years mixed microbial community flourishing right us now, plus minus modicum layers surface crustal material. i want say autonomous agents comprising community had, individually collectively, embodied know-how get making living natural games constituted world. indeed, i emphasized before, biosphere self-consistent coconstruction autonomous agents, ways making living, search procedures, mutation, recombination, well behavioral search open autonomous agents. those means making living well searched mastered agents search procedures became kinds ""jobs"" widely filled, abundant niches bio-sphere. there whole self-constructing system wider know-how, beyond know-how single autonomous agent spinning eagerly microenvironment. yet, clearly, know-how distributed. there autonomous agent, one, knows whole system works, anyone present knows global economic system works myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, frustrations. what world ""know-how""? philosophers distinguish ""know-how"" ""know that."" i know tie shoes learning play jazz drums.

wsj_2465.txt,"We don't know who is winning the drug war in Latin America, but we know who's losing it -- the press. Over the past six months, six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas -- who often are one and the same -- in Colombia. Over the past 12 years, at least 40 journalists have died there. The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August, trying to prevent their takeover of the country. The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey, Mexico, this week. On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity, the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador, Colombia's second-largest newspaper. The paper's local administrator, Maria Luz Lopez, was shot dead, and her mother wounded, while her car was stopped for a red light. An hour later, the paper's circulation manager, Miguel Soler, was shot and killed near his home. The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper's offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin. They bombed the Bogota offices last month, destroying its computer and causing $2.5 million in damage. El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff. At Monterrey, publisher Luis Gabriel Cano, although shaken by the murders, issued a statement saying: ""We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking. They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war."" This comes from a man whose brother, Guillermo, was murdered in 1986. The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions, but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today's editions. Many will use a common editorial. A final statement yesterday said: ""While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by assassination."" The report charged that Panama's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before. ""Noriega has closed every independent newspaper, radio and television station and arrested, tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters,"" the statement declared. It added: ""In Cuba, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever."" And in Nicaragua, promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas ""have not materialized."" As it happens, the four countries cited, Colombia, Cuba, Panama and Nicaragua, are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics. Noriega is close to Castro and may once have been his agent. Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua. In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. ""If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,"" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance.

Article247_400.txt,"            No More Kisses             In light of Secretary of State Albright's imminent trip to the middle east, the New York Times , Los Angeles Times and Washington Post emphasize the deteriorating situation there. But USA Today stays with Princess Di.             The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday, she will ""read the riot act"" to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism. Her goal will be to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel, telling him that there can be no more attempts at co-opting Hamas, and ""no more kisses"" of its leaders.             The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context. Given that the troubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat and Israel, but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the paper states that the U.S. is now facing the prospect that the moderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq and Iran is falling apart.             The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon, dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was ambushed, with twelve deaths the result. Perhaps the most striking indicator of a change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that cabinet member Ariel Sharon, who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israel entrenched in Lebanon in the first place, is among those urging a reconsideration of the deployment.             Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of its controlling stake of Compuserve, but it's the Post with the news that AOL is set to take it over.             The Wall Street Journal ""Outlook"" observes, ""In the U.S. job market, the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers,"" and states that ""the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of corporate downsizing,"" which left behind survivors who took stock of career options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land better offers, which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries. This has led, says the Journal , to annual compensation rising 5-6 percent a year.             Much of the continuing Diana coverage is spinning off into the realm of meta- and meta-meta-pieces. The LAT , for instance, examines what it takes to be a new ""cuddly-feely"" Britain born of the national grief experience. But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as well. Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwill ambassador job shortly before her death, and USAT reports that Le Figaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her family and children.             Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story. ""Not everyone in Calcutta, or India for that matter, is unanimous in praising the nun, whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this collapsing city's poor neighborhoods. Salvation--hers and that of the destitute she rescued from the gutters--was her aim, not economic or social development as many others understand it, she said."" It's odd, however, that in repeating this charge, the Times didn't interview the man most closely associated with it, Christopher Hitchens, or refer to the book where he set it out, The Missionary Position . Hmmm, wanna bet there was a copy of the book on somebody's desk at the Times though?             What's with the top-of-the-front headline the LAT puts over its picture of Martina Hingis standing next to Venus Williams after beating her at the U.S. Open--""Venus Brought Back to Earth""? Doesn't that sound like celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory? How odd--and a good illustration of how trying to shoe-horn in a ""witty"" headline can drive you into an idea that doesn't fit or is undeserved. Given that Ms. Williams' parents are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a still pretty-lilly-white sport, don't be surprised if there's a bit of a complaint about this.",24,709,4298,4.89,293,"no more kisses in light secretary state albright's imminent trip middle east, new york times , los angeles times washington post emphasize deteriorating situation there. but usa today stays princess di. the nyt states albright shows tuesday, ""read riot act"" yassir arafat cracking terrorism. her goal get arafat come decisively publicly peace israel, telling attempts co-opting hamas, ""no kisses"" leaders. the times emphasizes larger geopolitical context. given troubles west bank frosted relations arafat israel, also israel egypt israel saudi arabia, paper states u.s. facing prospect moderate arab coalition built persian gulf war contain iraq iran falling apart. the lat focuses new dissension within israeli government whether israel continue maintain forces southern lebanon, dissension fueled israeli commando raid late last week ambushed, twelve deaths result. perhaps striking indicator change mood inside government reported paper news cabinet member ariel sharon, defense minister 1982 got israel entrenched lebanon first place, among urging reconsideration deployment. several papers word h r block finally wriggled controlling stake compuserve, post news aol set take over. the wall street journal ""outlook"" observes, ""in u.s. job market, balance power shifting employees employers,"" states ""the retention frenzy triggered part previous waves corporate downsizing,"" left behind survivors took stock career options used internet job listings intensified recruiting land better offers, turn led counter-offers higher salaries. this led, says journal , annual compensation rising 5-6 percent year. much continuing diana coverage spinning realm meta- meta-meta-pieces. the lat , instance, examines takes new ""cuddly-feely"" britain born national grief experience. but usat wp also run pretty newsy diana pieces well. both reveal tony blair conferred diana goodwill ambassador job shortly death, usat reports le figaro says dying diana gave two crash witnesses message family children. give nyt credit getting mother teresa back front page bonus point including criticism story.

chZ.txt,"Zoot Suit A style of suit worn by African Americans, Filipino Americans, and Mexican Americans during the 1930s and 1940s. In Chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos of the 1940s. The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs, long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads, thick-soled shoes, and long watch chains dangling from the belt. An addition to the whole style common to Chicanos was a particular haircut, long with a ducktail and a wide-brimmed hat. The word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem, and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style. Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing, the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders, that later became known as the zoot suit. In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, he describes the zoot--suiters’ style, “walking slowly, their shoulders swaying, their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men” (1947, 380). In the late-night jazz scenes of Harlem this style was “a killer-diller coat with a drape-shape, reat-pleats and shoulders padded like a lunatic’s cell” (380). Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume, which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing. The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth, and the finger-tipped coat was made for fun and leisure. The long baggy pants were made for dancing, especially the jitterbug, and the wide Panama hats were another sign of adulthood. “The business of fun, dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by Zoot-Suiters. It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of free-wheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture” (Tyler, 23). Prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit, such as Cab Calloway, Sammy Davis Jr., and Duke Ellington. Ellington performed at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in 1941 and 1942 with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits, also known as Gone with the Wind suits, after the style worn by Clark Gable in the movie by the same name. Even though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities, it is primarily identified with the pachucos of Los Angeles. Pachucos were mostly second-generation Mexicans, the sons of migrant laborers and working-class immigrants. Pachucos created their own subculture, an arrogant style of dressing, a bilingual secret argot, and for some individuals membership in petty criminal gangs. The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zoot-suiter as neither a Mexican nor an American. It was not a bicultural or binational position, but rather a position between cultures, a “hanging in space” position. The overly confident, slow swagger of the pachuco, today exemplified by the cholo, made it appear in fact as if the zoot-suiter were walking on air. During the summer of 1943 the attention of the whole country was on Los Angeles when gangs of sailors and zoot-suiters battled with each other in the streets of the city. It is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked, beat, and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zoot-suiters. Between the third and thirteenth of June zoot-suiters were open targets. Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectives. During the late 1970s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by Luis Valdez. In 1981 a film by the same name, Zoot Suit, was produced and directed by Luis Valdez, with performances by actors Daniel Valdez and Edward James Olmos.

The word Zozobra translates to “gloom” or “worry” or “anguished.” The Zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta, which symbolizes the end of destructiveness, gloom, and worry, setting the tone for a successful fiesta. The creation of Zozobra was introduced into the fiesta in 1926 by Will Shuster, who felt that the fiesta had become “dull and commercialized.” Throughout the years the image of Zozobra changed from a simple twenty-foot puppet to the elaborate forty-foot figure with animated eyes, arms, and mouth that he is today. In 1969 Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe. He is hung on a tall pole on a hill, outside the city, where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch. The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happiness. In response to the tradition of the burning of Zozobra, a group of New Mexico Chicanos started a tradition of burning El Kookoóee, a figure known by many Chicanos as the bogeyman, during the Festival de Otoño.

An understanding that, above anything else, success       requires genuine effort, a willingness to set challenging goals. Caring       about others.       These are the attributes we want all children to have. You help       Jameson campers reach for them. If these special children are to become       the adults we all need them to be, we have to lead them in the right       direction right now.

YL teens will make J.C. juniors happen again this year for       7 and 8 year old campers. A five day camp, J.C. juniors introduces       at-risk children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously       reach them. That means we now have the opportunity to be a stable,       positive and important part of each child's life for an entire       decade.       The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for       other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them. And their       activities aren't isolated to Jameson. The teens have undertaken a       volunteer project to regularly visit with sick children at a local       hospital.       Please consider renewing your gift today. The kids need your       leadership now more than ever.

He knew he had made a bad       mistake, but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life, he just       didn't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path.       Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up       on the street. He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps       until he could find a job and a place to live. The Trustee referred him       to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill's Career Academy staff       for job search assistance.       Jerry's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately. But Jerry's       troubles didn't end there. The seasonal construction job he obtained soon       ended, and he returned to Career Academy for help once more. Unemployed,       homeless and with a prison record, Jerry now faced going back to prison       for failure to pay child support.       It took some time and hard work, but with the help of Goodwill, Jerry       was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor's office, find       housing and conduct a more thorough job search.       With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana,       many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment. Of the       more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999, over 5,000 of them have       multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job. Some, like Jerry, are       ex-offenders. Some are blind, deaf or have other physical disabilities.       More than 100 were homeless.       But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to       overcome, like Jerry. With a promising new job at a plastic injection       molding manufacturer, his legal troubles in check and a safe place to       live, Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself       and contributing to his community. For as long as he needs it, Goodwill       will continue to help.       Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement       services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful       employment. And, with your assistance, Goodwill can help employers       develop resources to keep workers on the job.       Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending       a gift to Goodwill. Your generosity will help people help themselves.       Sincerely,       James M.

116CUL034.txt,"      October 7, 1996       Name Address City, ST Zip       Dear Name:       In the summer of 1993, the Marion County Commission on Youth began       what can best be described as a ""new era"" in its history. MCCOY was       reorganized as an independent, not-for-profit agency, separate from local       government. It retained, however, the same mission with which it had been       charged from its inception: to serve as a catalyst for effective,       coordinated, and collaborative service delivery to youth in our       community.       For the past three years, MCCOY has been actively engaged in       accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others:       youth service providers, youth, funding bodies, and interested citizens       to name a few.       We have met with a number of successes along the way, most notably the       Summer Fun Line, the Metro Summer Bus Pass, and the development of ten       neighborhood youth councils. A Providers Council and a Youth Coalition       are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the       years to come. The formation of The Community Academy, a pilot project       directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about       as a result of MCCOY's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response       to a pressing issue.       McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community       collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the       inclusion of young people in both decision-making and program planning       processes. One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the       United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of       Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne,       Indiana. As a team, these three organizations are working with       neighborhood youth and adults to build a ""Caring Neighborhood with Youth""       , mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a       better neighborhood for all.       Since its re-organization, MCCOY has established its unique niche       within the community by refraining from direct service programming and       focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening       groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs,       and moving toward collaborative solutions. McCoy has only one interest:       the well being of Marion County's young people.       McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount       of $10,000.00 to support such activities as:       ---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth       empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of       neighborhood-based youth councils; ---- the promotion of youth employment       opportunities; ---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding       effective and efficient youth service delivery;       ---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to       neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships;       ---- the development of community-wide supports for the positive       growth of all Marion County young people.       In the last several years, the business and corporate community has       recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to       the development of a competent workforce. Youth who are supported and       encouraged by both a family and a society that values       Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and       contributing members of adult society. While we have made significant       inroads, there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do       it alone. We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be       successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people       can grow and develop well. Your contribution will enable us to both       continue and expand the good work we have begun in making Indianapolis a       city famous for its commitment to youth and families.       In our fund raising efforts to date, we have received the support of       local government, foundations, and corporations as well as the personal       financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members. We believe there       is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative       effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community       as a whole.

lw1.txt,"Tara stood stock-still, waiting for the first tiny gleam from the scout craft to appear in the darkness of the wormhole. The gentle constant breeze of recycled air from the vent above blew an annoying hair against her nose, but she ignored it. A gasp from the psychic broke her silent vigil, and she turned. ""Results, Harmon?"" she suppressed the surge of annoyance that ran through her as she contemplated the psi's gift of getting all the hot news first. Harmon's face slowly animated - joy sweeping in to replace stern concentration. ""Tarrin says the planet's a freaking gemstone! Thriving with life, large and small forms, no buildings of any kind, hydrocarbons, metals, and a stable atmosphere. He's not even bringing them back through for a face to face briefing. He says we should come through now, immediately, before the probe is reported late."" ""Harmon, tell that good for nothing son of a beta to get his hindquarters through the gate and back here NOW, or I'll open fire on him when we come back through."" Tara fumed. Of all the impertinence! Tarrin, no doubt with orders from Mason, was questioning her command decisions. That's what I get for not using mercenaries. She returned to her watch, regarding her own reflection in the long window. Mahogany-black curly hair, cut short in the typical military style framed a careworn, dark-skinned face. It was not an attractive face right now; her ebony eyes shadowed by hours on the watch, full lips pursed with frustration. She had the look of every leader she had ever known. At six foot two, she stood a full head taller than even her Arrallin first officer. Her glowering expression completed the imposing effect. She picked imaginary flecks off her stark gray jumpsuit, and snorted. You look like hell, Tar. Don't blow this. Don't let fatigue get to you. She used the discretion of the mirrored window to secretively survey her crew. Harmon was an excellent addition to the bridge team, but was she open minded enough to defy United Earth Command and sever all ties from Earth? She watched the psi bob her head, unaware of the rest of the bridge, shaking blonde curls as she chattered away with the approaching psi relay on Mason's ship. She seemed so depthless - self conscious and shallow on the outside, but having that incredible gift. There had to be more to her. Well, if she didn't pan out, she'd be terminated. Any crew member that would jeopardize the project was meat. It would be a shame to lose that talent, though. Rakal, her first officer, was staring pensively at his panel. He was what this was all about. She watched his graceful fingers ending in thick black claws tap out calculations on the panel. His pointed ears swiveled back and forth, catching every sound from the bridge, while his long tail swished to the rhythm of his thoughts. Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was no common 'beta furry'. His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat. His eyes had been treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden yellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin, and leader of his hive. Right now, he looked like an overgrown wolf who'd learned touch-typing. The scout ship re-emerged from the hole - a brilliant speck emerging from a sphere of velvety blackness. It's hail crackled across the comm, and Tara spun to retake her seat at the helm. ""Launch the second probe. Won't Central be crushed to learn that another gateway has yielded little more than a class F planet and a white dwarf system. Level 1 and 2 staffers should prepare to be briefed and move out. This sounds like it's the one."" The distinctive whuffle of pleasure rippled through the betas on the bridge, and Rakal let loose a small growl, as if to caution his charges against false hope. They'd scouted twenty-seven gates so far, and none had turned up anything worth the Insurrection's time. Tara would not let giddy hopes drag them onto a rock that would spell the end for the project, and the Arrallin species.",50,730,4172,4.72,281,"tara stood stock-still, waiting first tiny gleam scout craft appear darkness wormhole. the gentle constant breeze recycled air vent blew annoying hair nose, ignored it. a gasp psychic broke silent vigil, turned.

chapter-10.txt,"            WARTIME             After the attacks had occurred, while crisis managers were still sorting out a number                 of unnerving false alarms, Air Force One flew to Barksdale Air Force Base in                 Louisiana. One of these alarms was of a reported threat against Air Force One                 itself, a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic                 White House Situation Room that morning.             While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington, by the time                 Air Force One was airborne at 9:55 A.M. the Secret Service, the President's                 advisers, and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising against it. President                 Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and, at about 10:10, Air Force One changed                 course and began heading due west. The immediate objective was to find a safe                 location-not too far away-where the President could land and speak to the American                 people. The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring                 down the size of the traveling party. The President's military aide, an Air Force                 officer, quickly researched the options and, sometime around 10:20, identified                 Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination.             When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45, personnel from the local                 Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield. The motorcade consisted                 of a military police lead vehicle and a van; the proposed briefing theater had no                 phones or electrical outlets. Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the                 President's remarks, while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security                 situation with superiors in Washington. The President completed his statement, which                 for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live, and the traveling party                 returned to Air Force One. The next destination was discussed: once again the Secret                 Service recommended against returning to Washington, and the Vice President agreed.                 Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and                 control facilities, and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for 50                 persons. The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several                 days, if necessary.             Air Force One arrived at Offutt at 2:50 P.M. At about 3:15, President Bush met with                 his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference.             Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words, ""We're at war,"" and that Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said                 the agency was still assessing who was responsible, but the early signs all pointed                 to al Qaeda. That evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending                 presidential directive they had labored over during the summer.             The secretary of defense directed the nation's armed forces to Defense Condition 3,                 an increased state of military readiness.             For the first time in history, all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United                 States were grounded, stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country.                 Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had                 been implemented.   The Pentagon had been struck; the White House or the Capitol had                 narrowly escaped direct attack. Extraordinary security precautions were put in place                 at the nation's borders and ports.             In the late afternoon, the President overruled his aides' continuing reluctance to                 have him return to Washington and ordered Air Force One back to Andrews Air Force                 Base. He was flown by helicopter back to the White House, passing over the                 still-smoldering Pentagon. At 8:30 that evening, President Bush addressed the nation                 from the White House. After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the                 injured and protect against any further attacks, he said: ""We will make no                 distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor                 them."" He quoted Psalm 23-""though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death .                 . ."" No American, he said,""will ever forget this day.""             Following his speech, President Bush met again with his National Security Council                 (NSC), expanded to include Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and Joseph                 Allbaugh, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Secretary of                 State Colin Powell, who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks, joined                 the discussion. They reviewed the day's events.             IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME             As the urgent domestic issues accumulated, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua                 Bolten chaired a temporary ""domestic consequences"" group.             The agenda in those first days is worth noting, partly as a checklist for future                 crisis planners. It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the                 flowing losses to the American economy, such as                 Organizing federal emergency assistance. One question was what kind of public                     health advice to give about the air quality in Lower Manhattan in the vicinity                     of the fallen buildings.                 Compensating victims. They evaluated legislative options, eventually setting                     up a federal compensation fund and defining the powers of a special master to                     run it.                 Determining federal assistance. On September 13, President Bush promised to                     provide $20 billion for New York City, in addition to the $20 billion his budget                     director had already guessed might be needed for the country as a whole.                 Restoring civil aviation. On the morning of September 13, the national                     airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly improvised security                     standards.                 Reopening the financial markets. After extraordinary emergency efforts                     involving the White House, the Treasury Department, and the Securities and                     Exchange Commission, aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually                     competitive firms of the financial industry, the markets reopened on Monday,                     September 17.                 Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal                     operations.                 Evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry and cap its                     liability.             The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective                 government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems                 of protection and preparedness. Though a number of agencies had some part of the                 task, none had security as its primary mission. By September 14, Vice President                 Cheney had decided to recommend, at least as a first step, a new White House entity                 to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of                 combining them in a new department. This new White House entity would be a homeland                 security adviser and Homeland Security Council-paralleling the National Security                 Council system. Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush and                 other advisers. President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant-                 Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge-in his address to a joint session of Congress on                 September 20.             Beginning on September 11, Immigration and Naturalization Service agents working in                 cooperation with the FBI began arresting individuals for immigration violations whom                 they encountered while following up leads in the FBI's investigation of the 9/11                 attacks. Eventually, 768 aliens were arrested as ""special interest"" detainees. Some                 (such as Zacarias Moussaoui) were actually in INS custody before 9/11; most were                 arrested after. Attorney General John Ashcroft told us that he saw his job in                 directing this effort as ""risk minimization,"" both to find out who had committed the                 attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack. Ashcroft ordered all special interest                 immigration hearings closed to the public, family members, and press; directed                 government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were ""cleared""                 of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies; and ordered the identity of                 the detainees kept secret. INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration                 violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist                 connections; in the chaos after the attacks, it was very difficult to reach law                 enforcement officials, who were following up on other leads. The clearance process                 approved by the Justice Department was time-consuming, lasting an average of about                 80 days.             We have assessed this effort to detain aliens of ""special interest."" The detainees                 were lawfully held on immigration charges. Records indicate that 531 were deported,                 162 were released on bond, 24 received some kind of immigration benefits, 12 had                 their proceedings terminated, and 8-one of whom was Moussaoui-were remanded to the                 custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. The inspector general of the Justice                 Department found significant problems in the way the 9/11 detainees were                     treated.             In response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits of the 9/11 detainee                 program, the Justice Department cited six individuals on the special interest                 detainee list, noting that two (including Moussaoui) were linked directly to a                 terrorist organization and that it had obtained new leads helpful to the                 investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.             A senior al Qaeda detainee has stated that U.S. government efforts after the 9/11                 attacks to monitor the American homeland, including review of Muslims' immigration                 files and deportation of nonpermanent residents, forced al Qaeda to operate less                 freely in the United States.             The government's ability to collect intelligence inside the United States, and the                 sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement                 communities, was not a priority before 9/11. Guidelines on this subject issued in                 August 2001 by Deputy Attorney General LarryThompson essentially recapitulated prior                 guidance. However, the attacks of 9/11 changed everything. Less than one week after                 September 11, an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act (officially,                 the USA PATRIOT Act) began to take shape.             A central provision of the proposal was the removal of ""the wall"" on information                 sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities (discussed in                 chapter 3). Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action,                 within the limits of the Constitution, to identify potential terrorists and deter                 additional attacks.             The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of                 Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26.             Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States             Three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the                 United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11: (1) Did any flights of Saudi                 nationals take place before national airspace reopened on September 13, 2001? (2)                 Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals?                 (3) Did the FBI screen Saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure?             First, we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals, domestic or                 international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning                 of September 13, 2001.   To the contrary, every flight we have identified occurred                 after national airspace reopened.             Second, we found no evidence of political intervention. We found no evidence that                 anyone at the White House above the level of Richard Clarke participated in a                 decision on the departure of Saudi nationals. The issue came up in one of the many                 video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired, and Clarke said he                 approved of how the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency                 discussion at his level. Clarke told us, ""I asked the FBI, Dale Watson . . . to                 handle that, to check to see if that was all right with them, to see if they wanted                 access to any of these people, and to get back to me. And if they had no objections,                 it would be fine with me."" Clarke added,""I have no recollection of clearing it with                 anybody at the White House.""             Although White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card remembered someone telling him about                 the Saudi request shortly after 9/11, he said he had not talked to the Saudis and                 did not ask anyone to do anything about it. The President and Vice President told us                 they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media.                 None of the officials we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this                 matter from any political appointee.             Third, we believe that the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals                 who left the United States on charter flights.             The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBI's requirements that                 passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights                 departed.  The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI                 operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals                 and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart.             The FBI interviewed all persons of interest on these flights prior to their                 departures. They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11                 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion. Our own                 independent review of the Saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known                 links to terrorism departed on these flights.             PLANNING FOR WAR             By late in the evening of September 11, the President had addressed the nation on the                 terrible events of the day. Vice President Cheney described the President's mood as                 somber.  The long day was not yet over. When the larger meeting that included his                 domestic department heads broke up, President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top                 advisers, a group he would later call his ""war council.""  This group usually                 included Vice President Cheney, Secretary of State Powell, Secretary of Defense                 Donald Rumsfeld, General Hugh Shelton, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (later to                 become chairman) General Myers, DCI Tenet, Attorney General Ashcroft, and FBI                 Director Robert Mueller. From the White House staff, National Security Advisor                 Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group, often joined                 by their deputies, Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten.             In this restricted National Security Council meeting, the President said it was a                 time for self-defense. The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of                 the attacks, but also those who harbored them. Secretary Powell said the United                 States had to make it clear to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Arab states that the                 time to act was now. He said we would need to build a coalition. The President noted                 that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China. Secretary                 Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might                 have harbored the attackers, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, and Iran. He                 wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with                 these countries, pointing out that major strikes could take up to 60 days to                     assemble.             President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September 12. In the first                 meeting, he stressed that the United States was at war with a new and different kind                 of enemy. The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre-9/11 work and                 develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them. As                 they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign, they                 considered a paper that went beyond al Qaeda to propose the ""elimination of                 terrorism as a threat to our way of life,"" an aim that would include pursuing other                 international terrorist organizations in the Middle East.             Rice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September 13 in the Situation Room to                 refine how the fight against al Qaeda would be conducted. The principals agreed that                 the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm. The                 United States would need to integrate diplomacy, financial measures, intelligence,                 and military actions into an overarching strategy. The principals also focused on                 Pakistan and what it could do to turn the Taliban against al Qaeda. They concluded                 that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States, it too would be at                     risk.             The same day, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage met with the Pakistani                 ambassador to the United States, Maleeha Lodhi, and the visiting head of Pakistan's                 military intelligence service, Mahmud Ahmed. Armitage said that the United States                 wanted Pakistan to take seven steps:                 to stop al Qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical support for                     Bin Ladin;                 to give the United States blanket overflight and landing rights for all                     necessary military and intelligence operations;                 to provide territorial access to U.S. and allied military intelligence and                     other personnel to conduct operations against al Qaeda;                 to provide the United States with intelligence information;                 to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts;                 to cut off all shipments of fuel to the Taliban and stop recruits from going                     to Afghanistan; and,                 if the evidence implicated bin Ladin and al Qaeda and the Taliban continued to                     harbor them, to break relations with the Taliban government.             Pakistan made its decision swiftly. That afternoon, Secretary of State Powell                 announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had                 agreed to every U.S. request for support in the war on terrorism. The next day, the                 U.S. embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders                 had agreed to all seven demands."" Pakistan will need full US support as it proceeds                 with us,"" the embassy noted."" Musharraf said the GOP [government of Pakistan] was                 making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would                 pay a domestic price. His standing in Pakistan was certain to suffer. To                 counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his                     decisions.""             At the September 13 NSC meeting, when Secretary Powell described Pakistan's reply,                 President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban. He also                 ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the Taliban. The                 President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban, step back, wait to see if                 they got the message, and hit them hard if they did not. He made clear that the                 military should focus on targets that would influence the Taliban's behavior.             President Bush also tasked the State Department, which on the following day delivered                 to the White House a paper titled ""Game Plan for a Political- Military Strategy for                 Pakistan and Afghanistan."" The paper took it as a given that Bin Ladin would                 continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control. It                 therefore detailed specific U.S. demands for the Taliban: surrender Bin Ladin and                 his chief lieutenants, including Ayman al Zawahiri; tell the United States what the                 Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations; close all terrorist camps; free all                 imprisoned foreigners; and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions.             The State Department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the Taliban: produce Bin                 Ladin and his deputies and shut down al Qaeda camps within 24 to 48 hours, or the                 United States will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure.                 The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply. Therefore, State and                 Defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan. Both                 departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence,                 basing, and other support from countries, according to their capabilities and                 resources. Finally, the plan detailed a public U.S. stance: America would use all                 its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat, punish those responsible for the                 9/11 attacks, hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to                 terrorists, work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks, and                 avoid malice toward any people, religion, or culture.             President Bush recalled that he quickly realized that the administration would have                 to invade Afghanistan with ground troops.             But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options                 were disappointing.    Tommy Franks, the commanding general of Central Command                 (CENTCOM), told us that the President was dissatisfied. The U.S. military, Franks                 said, did not have an off-the-shelf plan to eliminate the al Qaeda threat in                 Afghanistan. The existing Infinite Resolve options did not, in his view, amount to                 such a plan.             All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September                 15-16, as President Bush convened his war council at Camp David.             Present were Vice President Cheney, Rice, Hadley, Powell, Armitage, Rumsfeld,                 Ashcroft, Mueller, Tenet, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and Cofer                 Black, chief of the DCI's Counterterrorist Center.             Tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations. He                 proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would                 join the fight against al Qaeda.  These CIA teams would act jointly with the                 military's Special Operations units. President Bush later praised this proposal,                 saying it had been a turning point in his thinking.             General Shelton briefed the principals on the preliminary plan for Afghanistan that                 the military had put together. It drew on the Infinite Resolve ""phased campaign""                 plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November 2000 as an addition to the strike                 options it had been refining since 1998. But Shelton added a new element-the                 possible significant use of ground forces- and that is where President Bush                 reportedly focused his attention.             After hearing from his senior advisers, President Bush discussed with Rice the                 contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion. Rice                 prepared a paper that President Bush then considered with principals on Monday                 morning, September 17. ""The purpose of this meeting,"" he recalled saying,""is to                 assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism. It starts today.""             In a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting,                 President Bush charged Ashcroft, Mueller, and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland                 defense. President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to deliver an ultimatum                 to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed. The                 State Department was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize Pakistan and to be                 prepared to notify Russia and countries near Afghanistan when hostilities were                     imminent.             In addition, Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action                 in Afghanistan, including the administration's first Memorandum of Notification on                 Bin Ladin. Shortly thereafter, President Bush authorized broad new authorities for                 the CIA.             President Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David                 military plan to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the                 ultimatum. The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to                 protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented                 worldwide. Finally, he directed Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to craft a plan to                 target al Qaeda's funding and seize its assets.             NSC staff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fund-raising by September                     18.             Also by September 18, Powell had contacted 58 of his foreign counterparts and                 received offers of general aid, search-and-rescue equipment and personnel, and                 medical assistance teams.             On the same day, Deputy Secretary of State Armitage was called by Mahmud Ahmed                 regarding a two-day visit to Afghanistan during which the Pakistani intelligence                 chief had met with Mullah Omar and conveyed the U.S. demands. Omar's response was                 ""not negative on all these points."" But the                 administration knew that theTaliban was unlikely to turn over Bin Ladin.             The pre-9/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive,                 National Security Presidential Directive 9, now titled ""Defeating the Terrorist                 Threat to the United States."" The directive would now extend to a global war on                 terrorism, not just on al Qaeda. It also incorporated the President's determination                 not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them. It included a                 determination to use military force if necessary to end al Qaeda's sanctuary in                 Afghanistan. The new directive-formally signed on October 25, after the fighting in                 Afghanistan had already begun-included new material followed by annexes discussing                 each targeted terrorist group. The old draft directive on al Qaeda became, in                 effect, the first annex.             The United States would strive to eliminate all terrorist networks, dry up their                 financial support, and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. The                 goal was the ""elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life.""             ""PHASE TWO"" AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ             President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein's                 regime might have had a hand in it. Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for                 11 years, and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in                 ongoing combat operations. As a former pilot, the President was struck by the                 apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting, especially                 Hanjour's high-speed dive into the Pentagon. He told us he recalled Iraqi support                 for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well. Speculating about other possible states                 that could be involved, the President told us he also thought about Iran.             Clarke has written that on the evening of September 12, President Bush told him and                 some of his staff to explore possible Iraqi links to 9/11. ""See if Saddam did this,""                 Clarke recalls the President telling them."" See if he's linked in any way."" While he believed the details of Clarke's account to be                 incorrect, President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at                 some point, asking him about Iraq.             Responding to a presidential tasking, Clarke's office sent a memo to Rice on                 September 18, titled ""Survey of Intelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in                 the September 11 Attacks."" Rice's chief staffer on Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad,                 concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al                 Qaeda. The memo found no ""compelling case"" that Iraq had either planned or                 perpetrated the attacks. It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports,                 including the Czech report alleging an April 2001 Prague meeting between Atta and an                 Iraqi intelligence officer (discussed in chapter 7) and a Polish report that                 personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad were told before                 September 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event.                 Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak, the memo pointed                 out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein's regime. Finally, the                 memo said, there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on                 unconventional weapons.             On the afternoon of 9/11, according to contemporaneous notes, Secretary Rumsfeld                 instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible. The                 notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking                 empty training sites. He thought the U.S. response should consider a wide range of                 options and possibilities. The secretary said his instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein                 at the same time-not only Bin Ladin. Secretary Rumsfeld later explained that at the                 time, he had been considering either one of them, or perhaps someone else, as the                 responsible party.             According to Rice, the issue of what, if anything, to do about Iraq was really                 engaged at Camp David. Briefing papers on Iraq, along with many others, were in                 briefing materials for the participants. Rice told us the administration was                 concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks. She recalled that in                 the first Camp David session chaired by the President, Rumsfeld asked what the                 administration should do about Iraq. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for                 striking Iraq during ""this round"" of the war on terrorism.             A Defense Department paper for the Camp David briefing book on the strategic concept                 for the war on terrorism specified three priority targets for initial action: al                 Qaeda, theTaliban, and Iraq. It argued that of the three, al Qaeda and Iraq posed a                 strategic threat to the United States. Iraq's long-standing involvement in terrorism                 was cited, along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction.             Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz-not Rumsfeld-argued that Iraq was ultimately                 the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked.             Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq was behind                 9/11. ""Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt                 with,"" Powell told us."" And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to                 deal with the Iraq problem."" Powell said that President Bush did not give                 Wolfowitz's argument ""much weight."" Though continuing to                 worry about Iraq in the following week, Powell said, President Bush saw Afghanistan                 as the priority.             President Bush told Bob Woodward that the decision not to invade Iraq was made at the                 morning session on September 15. Iraq was not even on the table during the September                 15 afternoon session, which dealt solely with Afghanistan.             Rice said that when President Bush called her on Sunday, September 16, he said the                 focus would be on Afghanistan, although he still wanted plans for Iraq should the                 country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been                 involved in the 9/11 attacks.             At the September 17 NSC meeting, there was some further discussion of ""phase two"" of                 the war on terrorism.             President Bush ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if                 Baghdad acted against U.S. interests, with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi                 oil fields.             Within the Pentagon, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for                 dealing with Iraq. Writing to Rumsfeld on September 17 in a memo headlined                 ""Preventing More Events,""he argued that if there was even a 10 percent chance that                 Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attack, maximum priority should be placed on                 eliminating that threat. Wolfowitz contended that the odds were ""far more"" than 1 in                 10, citing Saddam's praise for the attack, his long record of involvement in                 terrorism, and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the                 1993 attack on the World Trade Center.    The next day, Wolfowitz renewed the                 argument, writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator in the                 1995 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives-laden plane into CIA headquarters,                 and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis' involvement in the                 attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight. Given this background, he wondered why so                 little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots, seeing a ""failure                 of imagination"" and a mind-set that dismissed possibilities.             On September 19, Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked                 on their contingency plans. Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the                 conflict, the references to specific enemies or regions named only the Taliban, al                 Qaeda, and Afghanistan.             Shelton told us the administration reviewed all the Pentagon's war plans and                 challenged certain assumptions underlying them, as any prudent organization or                 leader should do.             General Tommy Franks, the commanding general of Central Command, recalled receiving                 Rumsfeld's guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans                 meant for his area of responsibility. He knew he would soon be striking the Taliban                 and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. But, he told us, he now wondered how that action was                 connected to what might need to be done in Somalia, Yemen, or Iraq.             On September 20, President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the                 two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead. When Blair asked about Iraq, the                 President replied that Iraq was not the immediate problem. Some members of his                 administration, he commented, had expressed a different view, but he was the one                 responsible for making the decisions.             Franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on                 military responses in Iraq during the summer before 9/11-a request President Bush                 denied, arguing that the time was not right. (CENTCOM also began dusting off plans                 for a full invasion of Iraq during this period, Franks said.) The CENTCOM commander                 told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi                 moves shortly after 9/11, both because he personally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda                 might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that Saddam might                 take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern                 or southern parts of Iraq, where the United States was flying regular missions to                 enforce Iraqi no-fly zones. Franks said that President Bush again turned down the                     request.             Having issued directives to guide his administration's preparations for war, on                 Thursday, September 20, President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session                 of Congress."" Tonight,"" he said, ""we are a country awakened to danger."" The President blamed al Qaeda for 9/11 and the 1998                 embassy bombings and, for the first time, declared that al Qaeda was ""responsible                 for bombing the USS Cole."" He reiterated the ultimatum                 that had already been conveyed privately."" The Taliban must act, and act                 immediately,"" he said."" They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in                 their fate."" The President added that America's quarrel                 was not with Islam: ""The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not                 our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every                 government that supports them."" Other regimes faced hard choices, he pointed out:                 ""Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make: Either you are with us,                 or you are with the terrorists.""             President Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin."" Our war on terror                 begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there,"" he said."" It will not end until                 every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated."" The                 President had a message for the Pentagon:""The hour is coming when America will act,                 and you will make us proud."" He also had a message for those outside the United                 States."" This is civilization's fight,"" he said. ""We ask every nation to join                     us.""             President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central                 Command's General Franks and other advisers on September 21 and October 2.                 Originally titled ""Infinite Justice,"" the operation's code word was changed-to avoid                 the sensibilities of Muslims who associate the power of infinite justice with God                 alone-to the operational name still used for operations in Afghanistan:""Enduring                     Freedom.""             The plan had four phases.                 In Phase One, the United States and its allies would move forces into the                     region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as                     Uzbekistan and Pakistan. This occurred in the weeks following 9/11, aided by                     overwhelming international sympathy for the United States.                 In Phase Two, air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al                     Qaeda and Taliban targets. In an innovative joint effort, CIA and Special                     Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan                     faction opposed to the Taliban. The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October                     7. The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially                     secured-after arduous effort-by the end of that month.                 In Phase Three, the United States would carry out ""decisive operations"" using                     all elements of national power, including ground troops, to topple the Taliban                     regime and eliminate al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan. Mazar-e-Sharif, in                     northern Afghanistan, fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U.S. forces on                     November 9. Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul. By early December,                     all major cities had fallen to the coalition. On December 22, Hamid Karzai, a                     Pashtun leader from Kandahar, was installed as the chairman of Afghanistan's                     interim administration. Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the                     Taliban.             In December 2001, Afghan forces, with limited U.S. support, engaged al Qaeda elements                 in a cave complex called Tora Bora. In March 2002, the largest engagement of the war                 was fought, in the mountainous Shah-i-Kot area south of Gardez, against a large                 force of al Qaeda jihadists. The three-week battle was substantially successful, and                 almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistan's equally mountainous                 and lightly governed frontier provinces. As of July 2004, Bin Ladin and Zawahiri are                 still believed to be at large.                 In Phase Four, civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task                     of what the armed forces call ""security and stability operations.""             Within about two months of the start of combat operations, several hundred CIA                 operatives and Special Forces soldiers, backed by the striking power of U.S.                 aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts, had                 combined with Afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to                 destroy theTaliban regime and disrupt al Qaeda. They had killed or captured about a                 quarter of the enemy's known leaders. Mohammed Atef, al Qaeda's military commander                 and a principal figure in the 9/11 plot, had been killed by a U.S. air strike.                 According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy, the CIA                 provided intelligence, experience, cash, covert action capabilities, and entrée to                 tribal allies. In turn, the U.S. military offered combat expertise, firepower,                 logistics, and communications.             With these initial victories won by the middle of 2002, the global conflict against                 Islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle.",278,6066,46245,5.27,2231,"wartime after attacks occurred, crisis managers still sorting number unnerving false alarms, air force one flew barksdale air force base louisiana. one alarms reported threat air force one itself, threat eventually run misunderstood communication hectic white house situation room morning. while plan elementary school return washington, time air force one airborne 9:55 a.m. secret service, president's advisers, vice president cheney strongly advising it. president bush reluctantly acceded advice and, 10:10, air force one changed course began heading due west. the immediate objective find safe location-not far away-where president could land speak american people. the secret service also interested refueling aircraft paring size traveling party. the president's military aide, air force officer, quickly researched options and, sometime around 10:20, identified barksdale air force base appropriate interim destination. when air force one landed barksdale 11:45, personnel local secret service office still en route airfield. the motorcade consisted military police lead vehicle van;

118CWL049.txt,"      August 6, 1998       Dear Friend:       Adolescence. It is a pivotal time in the life of a young girl-when       small changes in her behavior, or the choices she makes, can affect her       future. It's hard enough for her to make good decisions when she's       surrounded by support. It's even harder when she isn't.       Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring, responsible adult       volunteers with at-risk girls, ages 8-14. A Big Sister is a mentor, a       friend and a role model, helping a young girl to develop the       self-confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible,       productive and successful adult. Your $1,000 contribution can put a       mentor in a child's life-and hope in a child's future.       The results of an 18-month study completed by Public/Private Ventures       showed that children participating in one-to-one Big Sister and Big       Brother matches for just one year, reduced first time drug use by 46%;       lowered school absenteeism by 52%; cut aggressive behavior by 33%;       enhanced school performance; and improved relations with family and       friends.       This is positive proof that Big Sisters one-to-one mentoring program       helps change lives. Today, we are offering you the opportunity to help       change a life. By contributing $1,000 you can support one match for one       year. This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports       the development of effective relationships. This includes a volunteer       screening process, orientation, training and ongoing supervision and       support by a professional staff.       As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of ""your match"" and be       identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office, in the       agency newsletter and annual report.       Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana. But for       each girl served, more are left unserved. Over 235 girls are currently       waiting for a Big Sister. Imagine the difference the community could make       if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match!       I encourage you to Join me in presenting this matchmaker challenge to       your congregation.

As you begin that process this year, I would like to       ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more       positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County       Commission on Youth, Inc.       MCCOY Inc., originally founded as a government agency but re-organized       in 1993 as an independent not-for-profit, is a county-wide youth services       coordinating, planning, and convening agency. Its purpose is to encourage       collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies, programs, and       systems that serve our community's youth. In addition to that       behind-the-scenes role, MCCOY has taken an out-front role in developing a       Summer Bus Pass, neighborhood youth councils, and the We Value Youth       information line.

Article247_3500.txt,"            The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna             Dear Joe,             I know what you mean about being a journalist. Almost every assignment is a challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier. I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need. I think that is why I welcomed doing a book--it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism.             Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories. Most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public. Much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories. I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era (probably decades and decades hence as it is too close). In any case, there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons. I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur.             So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch. The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully. I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man--at AOL, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other ""characters,"" for lack of a better word. So there, while you think of Case, you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives. Steve Ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft, but it still seems to be Bill's show over there.             While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good. That's ironic, since I think it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley. AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here, I am sure, since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati. Out in the D.C. area, they looked positively exciting next to all the government-oriented contractors. I wonder if that means geography is destiny, and it's still location, location, location.             From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age. I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it's clear that the balance of power is shifting again, although it not clear where it will land. Will the strongman of the era be AOL, AT&T, Microsoft, or one of the big media companies? Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate?             I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney--is in charge of all our destinies: Babylon was. That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire's grip on humanity. But we all know how that story turned out.             Now I am getting way too philosophical, but this is my final missive, so why not? Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going. As for me, I'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and, I guess, life--nobody knows.

116CUL032.txt,"      August 4, 1999       Name Address City, ST Zip       The goal of MCCOY, Inc. has been to make a difference. In 1998, MCCOY,       Inc. led two efforts that, we believe, will help our community continue       to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop       well.       Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified       three goals for all our youth to obtain: economic self-sufficiency,       healthy family, social relationships, and involvement in the community. A       short time later, the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young       people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow       up well: caring adults, safe places to go, and positive things to do.       One group of adults and one group of youth, through two very different       processes, have arrived at the same conclusion; our community still has       much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into       the responsible, productive adults who will our community in the       future.       As a provider of youth services, MCCOY, Inc. is here to support your       valuable efforts to develop young people. Recently, through a lot of hard       work and alliances with organizations like yours, some steps have been       taken in our community that will help young people continue to be       involved in positive activities. One, IndyGo in April adopted a       much-needed policy that all young people under the age of 19 may ride on       their buses at half the normal fare all year long. Two, funding was made       available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct       positive youth programming on Saturday evenings. Through the youth       mapping process, it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for       youth on weekend evenings were lacking. That need is being met.       As it has been an exciting year for all of us, MCCOY, Inc. cannot do       its part without the support of organizations like yours. Annually, we       ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort       to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis. Enclosed is a donation       card that will enable you to make Indianapolis a great place for ALL of       us to live.

118CWL048.txt,"      Name Address City, State, Zip       Dear Name,       It's tough growing up today. We know that children do better when they       have a network of caring adults to nurture and motivate them. When young       people don't have that support, they need other resources for       encouragement to guide them along the way. Big Sisters helps bridge that       gap by providing children with the resources they need -- Big Sisters       volunteers.       Big Sisters are mentors and friends who empower girls to more fully       reach their potential, experience life's opportunities and perhaps begin       to dream. The relationships that are formed provide strong foundations       from which healthy values and strong self-confidence can grow, helping       youth become strong, independent adults of tomorrow.       This year we will serve over 1,000 girls through our mentoring       programs. This is an impressive number; but for each girl served, more       are left unserved. Over 150 girls are currently waiting for a Big       Sister.       You can make an impact by supporting Big Sisters Annual Campaign and       our $200,000 goal. If you are a regular contributor to the Annual       Campaign, I encourage you to consider increasing your gift by 10%.

Article247_66.txt,"            Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime             There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week this morning, furrow-browed and ""heartbroken with all the evidence coming out"" against the president. Last week, when the Lewinsky story was only a few hours old, Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to demonstrate his concern. ""These are probably the most serious allegations yet leveled against the president. There's no question that, if they're true, they ... could lead to impeachment proceedings.""             Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even disgusting about Stephanopoulos' eager show of independence from the president? The problem isn't so much his disloyalty. Political figures turn on each other from time to time, for good and bad reasons; we're used to it. Stephanopoulos wants to run for the Senate and doesn't want to seem a Clinton stooge. By lending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiar defenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he's not a fool.             The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in the first place. During the 1992 campaign, when Gennifer Flowers first brought Clinton's philandering to public attention, Stephanopoulos--as Clinton's chief spinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit artist--played a crucial role in discrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namely that Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem. (Don't say Stephanopoulos didn't know. Again, he's not a fool.) Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments.             The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on tape. Early in the film, with the Flowers crisis in full bloom, Sam Donaldson interviews Stephanopoulos, who blames it all on the ""Republican attack machine."" ""Gov. Clinton has no character problem,"" Stephanopoulos declares. Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to infidelity. ""He said he had problems in his marriage,"" says Stephanopoulos, correcting Donaldson's deviation from the pre-scripted fudge-phrase of the day. (Today, of course, the president's defenders claim that Clinton admitted infidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply didn't care.)             Near the end of The War Room, Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about to publicize. Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping quiet. ""You would be laughed at ..."" he tells the caller. ""I guarantee you that if you do this you'll never work in Democratic politics again. ... Nobody will believe you and people will think you're scum.""             You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught. He was one of Clinton's principal enablers, to use a word employed by Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times . When Democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton, they don't need to look much further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos, Carville (and a cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992.             Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst. It's as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid-'50s to soberly rue the damage wreaked by Sen. Joe McCarthy, without any apology for his own role. Much has been made of the way famous wrongdoers (e.g.: Dick Morris, Marv Albert) rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture. But usually at least a nanosecond of contrition is required. Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the country. If Clinton, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting to explode, then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and muffled the ticking.",36,636,4097,5.29,249,"stephanopoulos analyzes his own crime there former clinton aide george stephanopoulos abc's this week morning, furrow-browed ""heartbroken evidence coming out"" president. last week, lewinsky story hours old, stephanopoulos popped good morning america demonstrate concern.

112C-L015.txt,"      Dear Friends of Pleasant Run:       The holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying       gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be       with family and friends. This is the time of year when we give thanks for       the warmth and love that surrounds us. And this time of year is an       occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are.       Pleasant Run cares for at-risk children and families. We do this       through a wide range of programs including community- based, therapeutic       foster care, group homes and our treatment center. Many of the children       are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes.       Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a       contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1,500 children families we care       for. Many of the children have no homes; no memories of joy from past       holidays. Others are from families that are struggling to provide a       healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it       possible. Your contribution will make a difference in a child's life. It       may help a family stay together. It can certainly make happy holiday       memories.       A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have       presents to open. A gift means a family will have a holiday meal, cooking       utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on. Your gift will go       beyond the holiday season. It can help purchase clothing, school       supplies, books and educational tools throughout the year.       Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run. Let our       families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of       memories of the holidays you will have.

Article247_500.txt,"            Fashioning Paula                USA Today leads with Texas' settlement of its product-liability lawsuit against the leading tobacco companies. The top nonlocal story at the Washington Post is the latest development in the Indonesian economic crisis--a rare and boosterish Suharto press conference in contrast to a further plunging stock market and food riots in outlying towns. The New York Times leads with a comprehensive poll about American attitudes concerning abortion.             In the Texas case, reports USAT , the defendant companies have agreed to pay about $15 billion over 25 years to reimburse the state for expenses it incurred in the treatment of smoking-related illnesses. That makes Texas the third state to settle such a case, joining Florida and Mississippi. There are, says the paper, a total of 40 such suits on file, with Minnesota's turn coming next week.             The Wall Street Journal states that the plaintiffs' lawyers hired by Texas to try the case will receive as part of the deal almost $2.2 billion in fees.             The NYT abortion survey, the first conducted by the paper since 1989, was based on telephone interviews of 1,101 people and detects ""a notable shift from general acceptance"" of having the procedure: from 40 percent to 32 percent. And the pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortion timing: Sixty-one percent of those polled thought abortions should be permitted during the first trimester, but only 15 percent in the second and just 7 percent in the third. (The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why a focus on partial-birth abortions has proven politically advantageous for abortion foes.) Nearly 45 percent of those asked to state the present law on abortion could not give the correct answer.             The WSJ notes that the just-concluded football/TV deal will probably mean even steeper cable bills in the near future. Some local cable companies, the paper says, expect the fees they'll pay ESPN to go up more than 20 percent. And they're in the habit of passing expenses along to Joe Remote. Even nonsports fans will be affected, notes the Journal , because ESPN is usually part of basic cable service. (Which raises the question: Hasn't technology progressed to a point that would allow cafeteria-style programming choices by subscribers?)             A scan of the headlines found cheek-by-jowl on the WP 's Page A6 provides an interesting snapshot of the life of the modern Cabinet officer: ""[Ex-HUD Secretary] Cisneros's Ex-Mistress Pleads Guilty,"" ""[Labor Secretary] Herman Denies Allegations of Influence-Selling Scheme,"" and ""Two Tyson Foods Executive Indicted Over Gifts to [Ex-Agriculture Secretary] Espy.""             The WSJ reports that, according to an MIT survey, Americans are twice as likely to back a tax increase going toward the search for extraterrestrials than one for gene-cloning research.             The NYT reports that today's issue of the journal Science will describe an experiment in which people's biological clocks were reset three hours by shining a bright light on the back of their knees. The finding, if it holds up, says the Times , may lead to a simple way for airline travelers to fight jet lag.             Yesterday's Los Angeles Times ran a story under the headline ""Paula Jones Works on Her Court Appearance,"" which, illustrated by pictures of Jones, was all about the various looks she's had since stepping on the public stage. The piece concluded that she's finally graduated to an image that's ""sophisticated yet soft."" Today's WP ""Style"" section (that's the opposite of substance, remember) picks up that ball and runs with it, with a lengthy discourse on the new PJ. ""It is,"" hyperventilates the Post , one of the most jaw-dropping public make-overs ever."" Jones apparently has ""smoothed the frizzy mane of curls that once reached to such dazzling heights. Her makeup is now subtle and based on natural, not neon, hues. Her clothing is inspired by the boardroom instead of the secretarial pool. She has embraced the markers of dignity, refinement and power."" In true newspaper overkill fashion, the piece backs this up by consulting Cynde Watson, national makeup artist for Bobbi Brown Essentials, and Steven Zdatny, a historian at West Virginia University specializing in the aesthetics and politics of hair.             The placement of these two pieces is a PR triumph, but one carrying the seeds of its own destruction: If people know all this work is going into making Paula Jones seem a certain someone, doesn't that just make it obvious that she's really somebody else?",30,734,4641,5.14,253,"fashioning paula usa today leads texas' settlement product-liability lawsuit leading tobacco companies. the top nonlocal story washington post latest development indonesian economic crisis--a rare boosterish suharto press conference contrast plunging stock market food riots outlying towns. the new york times leads comprehensive poll american attitudes concerning abortion. in texas case, reports usat , defendant companies agreed pay $15 billion 25 years reimburse state expenses incurred treatment smoking-related illnesses. that makes texas third state settle case, joining florida mississippi. there are, says paper, total 40 suits file, minnesota's turn coming next week. the wall street journal states plaintiffs' lawyers hired texas try case receive part deal almost $2.2 billion fees. the nyt abortion survey, first conducted paper since 1989, based telephone interviews 1,101 people detects ""a notable shift general acceptance"" procedure: 40 percent 32 percent. and pollsters also detected increasingly acute sensitivity abortion timing: sixty-one percent polled thought abortions permitted first trimester, 15 percent second 7 percent third.

We want you to       Know why your support of Goodwill is so important.       Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and       Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that       comes with work.

A robust economy helps by       providing job opportunities, but to be honest, most of the people who       aren't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest       obstacles.       The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like       health care, transportation and child care -problems that are big enough       on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental       disabilities, illiteracy and lack of job skills.

112C-L013.txt,"      November 27, 1995       Dear Friend:       What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run       Children's Homes?       Little ones, like Baby Jessica, caught in the struggle between       adoptive and birth parents. Older kids, like Tracy and Kerry, left       homeless after a recent murder-suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and       Dad. Young adults, like Mary T., a jobless mother of three, trying       desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime-ridden       neighborhood. Real people!       There are thousands more. Families are being torn apart, and too       often, children are the victims. Kids like Tommie J., made a ward of the       court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father; Alice, sent to       a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders; and John       H., a recovering alcoholic, rebuilding a relationships with his family so       they can live together again.       Pleasant Run Children's Homes began serving children nearly 130 years       ago. Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil       War. Today, we serve children and families with a multitude of problems:       emotional, physical, psychological and sexual abuse. Some come from       families where, through therapy, there is hope for reunification. For       others, ""families"" are the counselors are housemates at the group homes       where they live.       The biggest tragedy is that the problems don't go away; they only       grow. In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families. In 1995       we will serve over 850 children and 340 families. In 1996, these figures       will triple. The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given       the opportunity to become happy, loving, and productive members of our       society. They welcome the chance to belong, to become self- sufficient,       to regain their self-esteem and confidence. Often it is a long, hard       struggle, but the results are well worth it.       For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children       and their families, we need your support. The Funding sources are       shrinking, but the needs grow explosively. Please ""help good kids get       better"" by sending us a contribution today. Your gift will give children       and families hope for improved tomorrows.

110CYL071.txt,"      November 15, 1994       Dear ,       Think of your greatest accomplishments. Think of the joy and success       they bring to you and your loved ones.       Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job.       Michael was born with cerebral palsy. Upon entering the work force, he       discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities.       For several years he performed packaging and clerical work. His most       recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs eliminated his       position.       For 18 long months Michael could not find a job. He resorted to public       assistance dollars to survive. Finally, Michael called Goodwill.       At Goodwill, Michael's counselors felt that his personable demeanor       could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match       where his people skills could shine.       After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person       for the job. As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments, he now       provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night.       At last, he has found success in a job that he loves. Now his goals       are set on moving up in the company.       Every year, thousands of people come to Goodwill. Like Michael, they       share two common characteristics. They face some barrier to employment       and they want to work.       With support from people like you, they can overcome their barriers       and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it. And then       the pay-off begins for the entire community.       Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public       support and more paying taxes. Last year, participants in Goodwill       programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million.       Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of       a million dollars in public assistance.       The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however.       The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms       of a house to live in, money to purchase food -- without food stamps --       and the beginning of a family focused on success, not hopelessness.       Won't you help make all of these successes possible? Please send the       largest contribution you can comfortably make. Your gift will help give       new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason       to use the word.       Sincerely,       James M. McClelland President       P.S.

Article247_328.txt,"            Husbands and Wives             Chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext (and hence much of the appeal) of a Hillary Clinton-Rudy Giuliani Senate race would be Wronged Wife vs. Neglectful Husband. By running against Giuliani (who has been reported in Vanity Fair to have a mistress--he denies it--and, by all accounts, has a sham marriage), the first lady could exact symbolic revenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the Democratic party at the same time! That's almost enough for Chatterbox to jump on the Hillary for Senate bandwagon.             The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton's marital problems a major campaign issue. ""Giuliani makes Ken Starr look like a patsy,"" cried Time this week. But, er, wouldn't that be kind of a risky strategy, given his own problematic union? Many have already opined that the mayor is too vituperative, too much of a loner to practice the congenial, teamwork-oriented politics of the Senate; other doubters have pointed to his hardhearted, uncaring social policies. The last thing he needs is to draw more attention to these qualities in his personal life.             Giuliani's estrangement from his wife, Donna Hanover, is made clear in an interview with Hanover that appears in today's New York Times . Hanover ""would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did. But she did say in the interview, which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton's interest in the same New York Senate seat, that Mrs. Clinton is a 'very interesting' person. 'I think she's dynamic, and I think she's very smart, and she's an amazing speaker,' Ms. Hanover said."" And, for a punch line: ""Ms. Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said this week that Ms. Hanover had no comment on Mrs. Clinton's potential Senate campaign."" Does she have any comment on whether Ms. Hanover plans to be Hillary Clinton's campaign manager?                Indis Index                 Update: NBC, in its Juanita Broaddrick broadcast last night, turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by Broaddrick in the late 1970s that Bill Clinton raped her. This diminishes-- slightly-- the significance of Norma Kelsey's possible motives in verifying parts of Broaddrick's story. (One of the three is Kelsey's sister, whose motives can be similarly questioned; the other two heard Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip, as only Kelsey and Broaddrick's husband claim to have.) However, Chatterbox notes that NBC, like every other responsible news organization that's covered this story, reported that Norma Kelsey's father's killer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton, and remains perplexed that the Journal editorial page won't. Its Indis Index is today up to seven.                --Timothy Noah and Jodi Kantor",21,473,3004,5.15,173,"husbands wives chatterbox feels little dense realizing sooner subtext (and hence much appeal) hillary clinton-rudy giuliani senate race would wronged wife vs. neglectful husband. by running giuliani (who reported vanity fair mistress--he denies it--and, accounts, sham marriage), first lady could exact symbolic revenge philandering husband advancing fortunes democratic party time! that's almost enough chatterbox jump hillary senate bandwagon. the media conventional wisdom giuliani would make hillary clinton's marital problems major campaign issue.

112C-L012.txt,"      June 21, 1999       Name Address City, ST Zip       Dear ,       Do you remember the combination of elation and apprehension you felt       when you first left home? The young adults who leave Pleasant Run have       those same feelings. Very few have family support to get them started.       Many need furniture, linens and other basic necessities to begin lives on       their own.       To help them establish themselves in the community, the Pleasant Run       Emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to       provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our       programs.       Individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to       $500 from the Fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements: 1.       Release by the courts 2. Successful completion of all life skills tests       3. Positive termination of his or her Pleasant Run program 4. Possession       of a high school diploma or GED       Proof of meeting these, two staff reference letters and an essay       stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all       reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel, which determines if the applicant       merits the funds.       Such fund are often used for college tuition, vocational training or a       deposit on an apartment.       Because Pleasant Run is the only ""family"" for so many, our       Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first       steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive       adult.
